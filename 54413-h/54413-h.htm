<h2 id="c1"><span class="sc">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="small">THROUGH THE WINDOW</span></h2>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Bill Bolton, startled from a sound sleep,
sat up in bed.</p>
<p>His room was pitch dark. For a moment
or two he listened to wind whistling through
trees and the swishing pound of a heavy downpour.
Lightning flashed in the bright flare of
a summer electrical storm, and through open
windows he saw rain in steel rods lashing the
darker night.</p>
<p><i>Crash!</i> Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thunder, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said young Bolton
and lay down again.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Bill was out of bed in a jiffy. He heard
the unmistakable ping of a bullet as it struck
the rainpipe by his farther window.</p>
<p>Crash! Bang!</p>
<p>This time he dropped to the floor and lay
still. The second shot smashed a pane in the
upper window sash and knocked over a copper
water jar that stood on the mantel, sending
it rattling to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That lad,&rdquo; said Bill to himself, &ldquo;is
perched in a maple. Wild shooting, too&mdash;even
in the dark. I wonder what in blazes
he&rsquo;s aiming at!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crept on all fours to the window and
knelt before it, bringing his eyes level with
the sill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Crash! Crack! Bill winced. With the
thunderclap came a ball of red fire. It struck
a large northern maple, shot down the trunk
and vanished into the turf below the spreading
foliage. For an instant trees, shrubbery
and lawn were illuminated with red light.
Bill caught a glimpse of the flower garden
beyond broad lawns, and a group of figures
standing on the drive near the stone wall that
separated the Bolton estate from the highway.
He plainly saw a man drop from the big
maple to the ground. Then as he sprang to
his feet and leaned out of the window, the
glare was gone and black night shut down on
the world again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reach down and give me a hand, Bill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The muffled voice came from just below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; Bill spoke in the same cautious
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. Charlie Evans. I&rsquo;m hangin&rsquo; on
by the ivy and this leader&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t find
anything above me to get a grip on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, boy. Let me get hold of your wrist&mdash;that&rsquo;s
it. Mind you don&rsquo;t slip! The ivy
has been cut away from the windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill pulled, caught Charlie beneath his
shoulders and lifted him over the sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of their line of fire,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>As quickly as possible he closed both windows
and pulled down the green shades. A
moment later he found the wall-switch and
flooded the room with light. Charlie, a
round-faced, red-headed boy of twelve, still
sat on the floor. He was soaked to the skin
and breathing heavily.</p>
<p>Bill gave him one look and disappeared into
the bathroom. When he returned, he brought
a glass of water with him. Charlie grabbed
the tumbler and drained it in a few gulps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the berries!&rdquo; he wheezed. &ldquo;Got
another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon&mdash;too much in a hurry will make you
sick. Are you hurt? I mean, did those guys
wing you? I take it that you were the target
they aimed at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure was, Bill, but they&rsquo;re rotten shots.
Gee, I&rsquo;ve had a time of it, I tell you. Can&rsquo;t
I have another drink now? I&rsquo;ve been running
ever since they punctured the tires and I&rsquo;m
dry as an empty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but take your time drinking it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Bill followed Charlie into the bathroom.
&ldquo;You may be dry inside, but those clothes of
yours are soaking wet. Get out of them and
take a good rub down. And put on that bathrobe
on the door. If I&rsquo;m not in the bedroom
when you&rsquo;re through, wait for me there&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
be back as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went into the bedroom, and from there
into the hall. A night light was burning at
the foot of the staircase. Thunder still rumbled
in the distance but the storm was passing
over. Bill ran lightly down to the lower floor.
For a second he hesitated, then went into
the library on his right and shut the door behind
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>This room was on the same side of the house
as his bedroom. He went at once to a side
window, and pulling up the shade a couple
of inches, peered into the night. For a time
he could see nothing. Then as his eyes grew
accustomed to the darkness, he made out the
shadowy forms of six men in a group on the
driveway near the house. While he watched,
they separated, and one walked back to the
entrance, the others took up positions behind
the trees that lined the drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; muttered Bill. &ldquo;They evidently
think he&rsquo;s coming out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled down the shade and went upstairs.
Charlie was curled up in an armchair,
wrapped in the bathrobe, that was at least
six sizes too big for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he asked, as his tall,
broad-shouldered young friend came into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re posted along the drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, we&rsquo;ll never get out of here tonight,&rdquo;
grumbled the youngster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;you start at the beginning
and tell me why we have to leave here
tonight. What you&rsquo;re doing here in Connecticut&mdash;all
about it, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see&mdash;&rdquo; Charlie yawned prodigiously.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to start.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to start so very far back,&rdquo;
prompted Bill. &ldquo;We came up to New York
from Washington together a little over two
weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure did! After you got that medal
pinned on you by the President&mdash;gosh!&mdash;I
never thought I&rsquo;d shake hands with the President
of the United States&mdash;and have him tell
me I was a hero&mdash;before all those people,
too! It was swell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you thought so,&rdquo; Bill smiled
wryly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw!&mdash;Say, what&rsquo;s become of Osceola and
the two Heinies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the dope later. Never mind
that now. I want to know how you happened
to land in New Canaan at this time of
night&mdash;and chased by a gang of thugs who
don&rsquo;t mind trying to pot you! What&rsquo;s the
big idea?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, all right. Keep your shirt
on!&rdquo; Charlie yawned again. &ldquo;After the big
doings in Washington, Mother and I went up
to our summer place at Marblehead. Dad
didn&rsquo;t come with us. He stayed in Boston.
Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;today is Tuesday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wednesday morning,&rdquo; interrupted Bill,
with a glance at his wristwatch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s after
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;K-rect. Well, last Friday night Mother
got a telegram from Dad, telling her to send
me up to Clayton, Maine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the burg near Twin Heads
Harbor where we got the <i>Flying Fish</i> and
the <i>Amtonia</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed Bill in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s the dump. Well, Mother
didn&rsquo;t want to let me go alone&mdash;but I went,
just the same. Dad said in his wire that nobody
should come with me. Of course,
Mother had a fit, but Dad had said it was important.
Anyhow, I got to Clayton Saturday
night, and Dad met me with a car at the station.
He told me he had bought a house near
the shore, so we drove over there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is the house anywhere near Twin
Heads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it stands back from a small cove about
a mile south of the Heads. Baron von Hiemskirk&rsquo;s
old quarters at the other end of Twin
Head Harbor are about three miles away
through the woods, I guess. And say, Bill,
that sure is some queer house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s wrong with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the house is all right&mdash;a big barn of
a place. But Dad has it locked up like a
prison. There are solid wooden shutters to all
the ground floor windows, and he keeps them
barred day and night. We got in through an
underground passage from the garage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does sound queer. Who else was
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody. Dad&rsquo;s camping out in that house
alone. Naturally, I wanted to know all about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did your father tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a darn thing! He told me not to
ask questions. Said the less I knew, the better
off I&rsquo;d be. Sunday night somebody tried to
break into the place. Dad fired at him
through an upper window, but the man got
away, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if Mr. Evans were hiding from
something or somebody,&rdquo; Bill said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does,&rdquo; acquiesced Charlie.
&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t find out a thing. He wouldn&rsquo;t
let me go out of the house alone the whole
time I was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny business. When did you leave?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Monday night. That noon after lunch,
Dad told me to turn in and go to sleep&mdash;said
he had a job for me that night. He woke
me up for supper, and afterwards he told me
he wanted me to fetch you up there. He
said &lsquo;Tell Bolton I need him&mdash;need him
badly. Say that I know he will be going back
to Annapolis in about a month, and I hate taking
time from his holidays. But tell him that
this job won&rsquo;t take long and that I believe
it will be even more exciting than that Shell
Island business, or the affair of the <i>Flying
Fish</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill slapped his knee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go! This is
my lucky day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, your lucky day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My birthday, kid. That&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many happy returns,&rdquo; grinned Charlie,
and yawned. &ldquo;How old does that make you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen,&rdquo; replied Bill, and he too,
yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the nerts,&rdquo; sighed Charlie. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t have one for four years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Born on February twenty-ninth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it the limit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill laughed. &ldquo;Too bad. But did your
father say anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heaps. About how I should drive to get
here. I was to drive all night, go to the
Copley-Plaza in Boston and sleep there Tuesday.
Tuesday night&mdash;that&rsquo;s tonight, I was to
leave there at eight and take the Post Road
to Darien. From there on, he told me exactly
how to find your house. Lucky he did. I&rsquo;d
never have reached here after those bozos held
up the car, otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just inside the New Canaan line, near
that flying field. I was makin&rsquo; that right turn
when a guy jumps into the road and holds up
his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gave her the gun, of course. But I missed
him,&rdquo; Charlie said ruefully. &ldquo;Then two or
three more of them started shooting. When
the tire burst I went into the ditch. The car
didn&rsquo;t turn over&mdash;so I hopped it. I kept in
the shadows of the trees. It was raining, and
black as your hat, anyway. Soon a car passed
me, going slow. Didn&rsquo;t see hide nor hair of
the bunch again until I climbed your stone
wall. Then I ran smack into &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know! We played hide
and seek round the grounds, then I saw your
open window. The storm broke about that
time. Kind of upset them, maybe. Anyhow,
I made for the ivy&mdash;and well&mdash;you know the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; Bill smiled and slapped him
on the shoulder. &ldquo;Any further instructions
from your Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said we were to start back at once.
Drive to Boston. Sleep there tomorrow and
drive up to Maine tomorrow night. He told
me to hurry&mdash;said that every hour counted,
and to bring along Osceola if he was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief and my father went to New
York for a few days. They won&rsquo;t be home
until the end of the week. They may go to
Washington, too. Some business connected
with Osceola&rsquo;s Seminoles. I&rsquo;m alone here
with the servants. Well, it&rsquo;s too bad, but
we&rsquo;ll leave a note for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;m sorry. Osceola would be just
the guy for a stunt like this. But how can
we make it, Bill? Take one of your old man&rsquo;s
cars? Mine is a wreck, down by the flying
field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do better than a car,&rdquo; pronounced
his friend. &ldquo;My Loening is stabled in the
hangar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! The amphibian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Now we&rsquo;ll hunt you up
some clothes, get some chow, leave that note
for Osceola&mdash;and take off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie jumped up from his chair. &ldquo;But
how can we? How about that gang outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me something easy,&rdquo; Bill suggested,
and started to dress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="sc">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="small">THE GETAWAY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty as a picture!&rdquo; said Bill and
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A picture no artist could paint,&rdquo; declared
Charlie rather ruefully, studying his reflection
in the mirror.</p>
<p>Arrayed in a jumper and sweater of Bill&rsquo;s
and a pair of linen trousers, converted into
shorts by hacking off the legs above the knees,
he made a comical picture indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; said Bill, surveying him, &ldquo;that
you&rsquo;ll have to go barefoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; returned Charlie. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went downstairs together and after
raiding pantry and icebox, sat down at the
kitchen table to a plentiful meal of bread and
butter, cold ham, milk and cookies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense waking the maids,&rdquo; Bill
was talking with his mouth full, &ldquo;the chauffeur
took Dad and Osceola to the city, and
those girls are better off asleep. If there&rsquo;s a
row outside with that bunch when we go for
the plane, they&rsquo;d probably raise the roof and
start phoning for the cops. And if Mr. Evans
had wanted the police to horn in on this business,
he&rsquo;d have got hold of them long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie finished his milk and attacked the
ham again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I figure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder he took the chance of sending
you, though,&rdquo; Bill went on. &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t
he have telegraphed me or phoned me? It
would have been quicker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. There&rsquo;s too much hush and rush
about this whole biznai to suit me,&rdquo; grunted
young Evans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, shake a leg,&rdquo; advised the older lad.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into the study to write a note to
Osceola, and leave one for Dad and the maids
as well. When I come back, we&rsquo;ve got to
vamoose. It&rsquo;ll be light soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not wait for sunup? Those lads
can&rsquo;t very well stick around after daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but if they&rsquo;ve got a plane handy, they
can trail us and make it darned disagreeable
at the other end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps they will, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we haven&rsquo;t taken off yet&mdash;much less
arrived. Come on, eat. You get no more
food until we reach Clayton, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill faded away toward the front of the
house and Charlie started on the cookies.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Bill was back again.
On his head was a soft leather helmet, while
strapped to his waist, the butt of an automatic
protruded from its leather holster. He laid
another flying helmet, goggles and a small
Winchester repeating rifle on the kitchen
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you! How&rsquo;s the tummy, full
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just about,&rdquo; grunted Charlie, stuffing the
remainder of the cookies into his trousers
pockets. &ldquo;Lead on, MacDuffer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slapped the helmet and goggles onto
his thatch of red hair and picked up the gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left lights burning upstairs and in the
study,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fool those guys yet.
It&rsquo;s the cellar for ours, come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited at the foot of the stairs and
beckoned to Charlie. &ldquo;Give me your paw.
We daren&rsquo;t show a glim down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Evans caught his hand in the inky
darkness, and presently Bill stopped again, released
his hand and could be heard fumbling
with something above their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;she&rsquo;s open at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie thought he could make out a lightish
blur on a level with Bill&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hand over the Winchester,&rdquo; his friend
commanded, &ldquo;and when you get through the
window, lie flat on the ground behind the
rhododendrons, and I&rsquo;ll pass it up. Don&rsquo;t go
scouting round by yourself, either. Wait for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie scrambled through the narrow
aperture, caught the rifle as it was handed up
to him, and crawling a foot or two along the
side of the house, lay still. Although it had
stopped raining, the ground was soaking wet.
Above him, the thick foliage of the rhododendrons
dripped moisture with every breath
of wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might just as well have kept my own
clothes,&rdquo; he thought, trying to accustom his
eyes to the darkness, but without success.
&ldquo;Hang it all&mdash;a little more crawling, and I&rsquo;ll
be sopping again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A whisper in his ear startled him. Bill
had reached him without a sound. &ldquo;Follow
me. Keep on your hands and knees&mdash;and
don&rsquo;t breathe so hard. I could hear you down
in the cellar, and I don&rsquo;t propose to have the
show given away just because you ate too
much! Come on, and stay right behind me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Charlie gulped down a retort and followed
Bill&rsquo;s lead along the house behind the wet
shrubbery. They had gone perhaps a hundred
yards in this manner, when Bill turned to the
left and crawled away through the bushes, on
an oblique from the house. Without stopping,
they crossed the drive, where the hard
gravel left its painful imprints on hands and
knees, and kept on through another belt of
shrubbery beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can stand up now,&rdquo; Bill whispered
and got to his feet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the back of the
house. Those guys are posted in front and
along the sides&mdash;No, they aren&rsquo;t!&mdash;not all of
them&mdash;Down, Charlie! Keep where you are
whatever happens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Footsteps crunched along the gravel on the
drive. Both lads crouched low. They saw
a dark figure move out of the shadows and
come directly toward them. The man walked
slowly, humming a tune. In the hollow of
his arm he carried a rifle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>When he was within a couple of paces of
them he turned on his heel and started back
the way he had come. Bill was up on the
instant. He took three crouching steps and
even Charlie, who watched with all his eyes
and ears, never heard a sound. Then he sprang
on his prey. Up went his right arm and down.
The man dropped like a poleaxed ox. Bill
dragged his body back to the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you kill him?&rdquo; Charlie&rsquo;s voice came
in a tense whisper.</p>
<p>Bill snorted. &ldquo;Nothing like that, kid. I
tapped him on the bean with my automatic.
He&rsquo;s out for half an hour or so&mdash;but that&rsquo;s
long enough for us. You stop here and go
through his pockets. Take any letters or
papers he may have about him. I&rsquo;ll be back
in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Bill&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like being left with a
dead man! Can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it, Charlie! If you don&rsquo;t obey orders,
you can hike back to the house. What&rsquo;s
the matter with you? This is no time for
fussing. I told you the man&rsquo;s only stunned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; grumbled the boy. &ldquo;I
wasn&rsquo;t afraid of him&mdash;honest I wasn&rsquo;t, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Carry on, then,&rdquo; said his friend,
as he melted into the bushes.</p>
<p>Charlie bent over the man on the grass and
consistently went through his pockets. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
bet Osceola taught Bill how to move that
way,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and if the chief ever gets
up to Maine, I&rsquo;m going to have him show me
how to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you mumbling about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie jumped. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Bill. Gosh,
you gave me a scare! What have you been
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Setting a trap. Got his papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two letters, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, then. We&rsquo;ll have to hurry.
He&rsquo;ll be missed soon. Here, I&rsquo;ll tote his
gun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Their course now led them back from the
house through a copse of hemlock. As they
came out of the little wood, Charlie saw a
blur of wooden buildings to the left. On
their right was a field of tall corn, and between
the two, a broad stretch of greensward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are the barns and garage,&rdquo; Bill
explained in answer to the boy&rsquo;s whispered
question. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody out here&mdash;yet. I
reconnoitered while you were frisking that
fellow. But we&rsquo;d better go through the corn,
just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, there&rsquo;s nobody here
<i>yet</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bus is parked in the hangar. Wait
till that nice inverted engine gets talking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think there&rsquo;ll be a fight?&rdquo; Charlie was
running now. It was hard going in the cornfield
between the tall stalks. He stumbled
frequently. His long-legged friend seemed
to know by instinct just where to plant his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it all depends on
how fast they can run, and which way they
come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Bill stopped on the edge of the field and
waited for Charlie. Before them now lay a
broad meadow. Over to the left the dark
shape of a building was visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the hangar?&rdquo; puffed the youngster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. It used to be a hay barn, but when
I got my pilot&rsquo;s license, Dad had it fixed up
with a concrete floor and a tin roof. The
<i>Loening</i> and the <i>Ryan</i> are both in there.
Well, I don&rsquo;t see anybody around. Let&rsquo;s make
a dash for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve been doing lately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That and eating,&rdquo; chuckled Bill. &ldquo;On
your toes, fat boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprinted across the open space and had
the hangar doors open when Charlie arrived,
puffing and half-winded by his efforts to make
fast time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow but sure,&rdquo; teased Bill. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
better at tucking away chow than you are at
track-work, Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, cut it out! How do you expect me
to keep pace with the Navy&rsquo;s star end?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, you did fine. Lend me a
hand and we&rsquo;ll wheel out the <i>Loening</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie pointed to the monoplane. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
that a <i>Ryan</i> M-1?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is. Come and get busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that type is faster that the <i>Loening</i>.
Why not take her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, my boy, she can&rsquo;t land on water
more than once, that&rsquo;s why. It may come in
mighty handy to have an amphibian up there
on the Maine shore. And don&rsquo;t think for a
minute this biplane can&rsquo;t travel. Wait till
you ride in her and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had wheeled the plane out on
the concrete apron, Bill went back and swung
the doors shut and locked them. Charlie was
already seated aft when Bill climbed into the
fore cockpit and adjusted his helmet, goggles
and safety belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo; he asked the youngster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safety belt fastened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. Keep that rifle handy. If those
lads get too close&mdash;let &rsquo;er go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Bill, you can trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill snapped on the ignition. The propeller
swung into motion as the inertia starter
did the trick. The engine sputtered, then
roared. He slipped into a heavy flying jacket
as the engine warmed up. Charlie, he knew,
had already donned his in the rear cockpit.</p>
<p>The engine was roaring smoothly as Bill
fitted the phones over his helmet and adjusted
the receivers over his earflaps. A mouthpiece
hung on his chest and a wire ran back to the
headset that Charlie wore. This would allow
them to talk in the air, even with the coughing
bark of the engine through the exhausts.</p>
<p>Bill stared up at the white fleecy cloud rolling
in over the field. Then he twisted his
head in the direction of the house, and cut
down the throttle speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come, Charlie!&rdquo; he said evenly.
&ldquo;Better get that rifle ready!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="sc">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="small">INTO THE AIR</span></h2>
<p>The lights of a car swung round the hemlocks,
then levelled directly on the field as
the automobile sped down the stretch of lawn
between the stables and the cornfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get off, Bill! They&rsquo;ll get us sure!&rdquo;
Charlie&rsquo;s treble shrieked into the receivers
clamped to Bill&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they won&rsquo;t! And for the love of
Mike, Charlie, don&rsquo;t shout like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s to stop them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo; said Bill briefly.</p>
<p>The speeding motor car bucked like a live
thing&mdash;described a half circling dive in the
air and crashed down sideways to its former
course. The headlights snapped out and both
lads felt the tremor of a dull explosion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jiminy! Somebody got hurt!&rdquo; cried
young Evans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope so. That, as the story-books say,
was my intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&mdash;what made it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember when I left you by the bushes
and you went through the gunman&rsquo;s pockets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just about then I was stringing a
wire between the old hitching post and the
horse trough. Looks to me as if the wire
held. Oh, blazes!&rdquo; he broke off&mdash;&ldquo;here
comes another car! Hadn&rsquo;t counted on a
fleet of them! Reckon you were right,
Charles. We should have got going sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he talked, Bill swung the plane into
the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they might stop at the wreck,&rdquo;
sighed Charlie. &ldquo;Coldblooded, I call it. Shall
I shoot?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Their job&rsquo;s to stop us. Gosh, no, you&rsquo;d
be wasting ammunition&mdash;never hit within
forty feet of them with all this jouncing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amphibian was gathering speed, rolling
lightly over the turf, but, leaping and
bouncing, the motor car drew closer. It came
alongside the moving plane, not more than
five yards off its starboard wing. Two men
hung to the running board, their guns spurting
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duck!&rdquo; yelled Bill.</p>
<p>He deliberately leaned over the cockpit&rsquo;s
side and fired his automatic at the automobile.
He saw the big machine swerve wildly, fall
behind and topple over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tit for tat.&rdquo; Bill lifted his plane prettily
off the ground. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one for you, Charlie.
I caught &rsquo;em in the near tire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two to one, you mean. And their cars
are in a lot worse shape than mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The engine was beating a steady tatoo. Bill
opened her up wide and pulled back on the
stick. Almost immediately they were in fog.
But he was no novice at the gentle art of piloting
an airplane. He had his air sense, flying
sense, and two instruments on the lighted dial-board
to guide him. The level glasses helped
a lot. His eyes went to the angle-of-climb
indicator, the bank indicator. He held the
amphibian in a steady climb for altitude.</p>
<p>The air was rough. White clouds of fog
obscured the wing lights at times. At other
times it was thinner. The engine was roaring
steadily, but Bill knew the danger of taking
off and climbing directly into a change
of temperature. He sat tight.</p>
<p>For about four minutes they climbed, in a
wide circle. And then there came a break
in the fog. A slice of the moon showed to
the southward. It was smothered by another
layer of fog almost instantly. The altimeter
showed eighteen hundred feet. Charlie&rsquo;s
voice sounded through the receivers of the
phone-set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you lost, Bill?&rdquo; His voice sounded
scared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; reassured his friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
looking for something&mdash;had to gain altitude
to put those guys off our track, if they happened
to have an airbus handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill dropped the plane into the heavier fog
below. Still flying in wide spirals, he came
out of it with the altimeter needle pointing
to four hundred feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost directly below them the bright
beam of a flashing light circled round and
round, cutting the night in a broad swath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The New Canaan airbeacon on Ponus
Ridge. We take our bearings from that
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hartford, Worcester, Lowell, Portland
and on up the Maine coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any idea of the distance?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a couple of hundred miles from
Lowell, and Portland is a good hundred and
twenty-five from that place. From there up
to Washington County and Twin Heads Harbor
is between a hundred and fifty to a
hundred and seventy-five farther. Say about
five hundred miles altogether. That&rsquo;s guess-work.
It&rsquo;s probably farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He banked the plane, swung it around in
a semi-circle and levelled off, headed into the
northeast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take us?&rdquo; Bill heard a
half-stifled yawn at the end of Charlie&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s going on for three now. If
this breeze on our tail stiffens, we ought to
make your Dad&rsquo;s house in less than five hours&mdash;say
somewhere between seven-thirty and
eight o&rsquo;clock, if we&rsquo;re lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad we have to get there in broad
daylight. Dad won&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not. But he&rsquo;s lucky we&rsquo;re getting
there at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say he is,&rdquo; yawned Charlie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, kid, you&rsquo;d better take a nap. Take
down your seat and curl up on the decking.
You&rsquo;ll find a couple of blankets stowed behind
the bulkhead aft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the best thing to do,&rdquo; the
youngster said sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Keep that phone
gear on your head, though. I&rsquo;ve got to wake
you before we get there. You&rsquo;ll have to point
out the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Nighty-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night and sweet dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Bill nosed up to six hundred feet. Above
him, the clouds of swirling fog seemed less
dense. His course led inland on a slant from
the shore. New Canaan lies up in the Ridge
Country, five or six miles back from Long
Island Sound. With every mile he put between
the plane and that body of water, the
air, both below and above him became
clearer and less bumpy. By the time the amphibian
was flying over Hartford, three-quarters
of an hour later, all signs of fog and
storm had disappeared. Moonlight flooded
the earth and the visibility was almost as good
as on a clear day.</p>
<p>It was past five o&rsquo;clock by his wristwatch
and broad daylight when the amphibian,
speeding at the same altitude, passed over the
city of Lowell, Massachusetts, and over Lawrence
and Haverhill, a few miles beyond.
They were nearing the sea again, and Bill
noticed that the closer they came to the coast,
the stronger was the wind from the southwest
behind them. A new thought came into his
head. With the quick decision of the trained
heavier-than-air pilot, he acted at once.</p>
<p>Out came his map, which he flattened on
his knees. Next, the cockpit light snapped on.
For a moment he studied his position. Then
the light went off and the map into the pocket
of his short leather jacket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The amphibian was a trifle tail-heavy, so
dropping the nose to level he gave her right
aileron and simultaneously increased right
rudder. Round to the right swung the nose
of the speeding plane. When the desired
bank was reached, he checked the wings with
the ailerons and at the same time eased the
pressure on the rudder. Half a moment later
he applied left aileron, and left rudder, resuming
straight flight, headed toward the
coast on a course that would take them fifty
miles east of Portland.</p>
<p>With wings level once more, he neutralized
the ailerons, gave the bus a normal amount of
right rudder and settled back comfortably in
his seat.</p>
<p>The little port of Cushing, just beyond
where the Merrimac River empties into the
sea, faded away behind them. Below now
was the blue Atlantic, dotted here and there
with the patched sails of fishermen, returning
with the night&rsquo;s catch. Far to the starboard,
hugging the horizon, Bill saw a large
single-stacker, a freighter, heading so as
to clear Cape Ann on her way to Boston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The day had dawned bright and clear. It
was perfect flying weather. With a twenty-mile
breeze spanking their tailplane, Bill
knew that they must be doing at least one hundred
and fifty-five M.P.H. He felt the exhilaration
of broad spaces and swift flight.
The salt tang of the sea smelled good. He
was content.</p>
<p>Half an hour or so went by. A sleepy voice
in Bill&rsquo;s receivers roused him from revery.
&ldquo;Where under the shining sun are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just there&mdash;or thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee&mdash;are we heading for Europe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. For breakfast, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are we doing over the ocean,
Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking a short cut, kid. This course will
lop off a good hundred and fifty miles from
the route via Portland and up the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it was the sea fog that made you
figure on the other way when we hopped off?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Bill laughed, goodnaturedly. &ldquo;You show
almost human intelligence this morning,
Charles. You&rsquo;ll be telling me next that the
sun is shining and the prop is turning round!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie snorted. &ldquo;Aw, cut it out, Bill.
Tell me, is there anything I can eat on board
this crate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you start on a strut. The
French have a saying that &lsquo;Who sleeps, dines.&rsquo;
If that is so you ought to be filled to the brim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; was Charlie&rsquo;s sole comment.
Then he asked: &ldquo;What are those islands
ahead to port?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matinicus Island and Matinicus Rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther is it to the Heads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a hundred miles. Our airspeed is
135 M.P.H., and we&rsquo;re running before a
twenty-knot wind. Figure it out for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you want the answer in acres?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;The answer I want,&rdquo; said Bill slowly,
&ldquo;is how I am going to land and park this bus
when we get there, if some more of your cut-throat
pals are hanging round the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; admitted Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would. Turn your
mighty brain on it. If you guess the right
answer I&rsquo;ll ask Mr. Evans to give you a lollipop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill paid no attention to the forth-coming
torrent of sarcasm from Charlie. His headphone
set lay on the floor of the cockpit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="sc">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="small">GAINING AN ALLY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Twin heads, Charlie!&rdquo; said Bill, resuming
his headphones sometime later. The
<i>Loening</i> was flying in from the Atlantic. Bill
had thought it wiser than trailing up the
coast for all eyes to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our house is over there to the left on the
other side of those woods,&rdquo; returned his companion
from the rear cockpit. &ldquo;Did you find
the answer, old groucho?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not, fat boy. As the poet has
it, we&rsquo;ll be guided by circumstances as we
find them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>He banked to port and leveling off, sent the
amphibian speeding over the treetops in the
direction indicated. He was flying low now,
barely a hundred and fifty feet above the
ground. His intention was to make a quick
landing if things looked propitious, rather
than to advertise their presence to these mysterious
enemies of Mr. Evans by spiraling
down from a higher altitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the house!&rdquo; called Charlie.</p>
<p>In a clearing Bill caught sight of a large
red brick mansion, with jutting wings and
high gables. All the windows were closely
shuttered. The house stood back, quite close
to the woods, amid unkempt lawns and shrubbery.
A broad avenue lined with maples led
across the clearing into the forest. He caught
a glimpse as they shot over, of stables and a
smaller building, also of red brick, two or
three hundred yards to the left of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s Dad&mdash;see him?&rdquo; shouted
Charlie.</p>
<p>A man walked from the front of the house
across the drive and stood watching them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see him,&rdquo; retorted Bill, &ldquo;but stop
your shouting or I&rsquo;ll be deaf for a week.
When we come back, strip your headgear and
stand up, so he can recognize you. Hold on
tight, though&mdash;it will be rough going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulling back the stick, he climbed to five
hundred feet. Then, leveling off, he made
a quick flipper turn over the farther woods
and headed back toward the house, nosing
downward, throttle wide open. Just before
reaching the garage, he zoomed, missing the
roof by inches. As he banked again to circle
back, Charlie&rsquo;s excited voice spoke through
his receivers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw me&mdash;he saw me! Look at him
now! Has he gone crazy, or what? Did you
ever see anything so silly&mdash;waving his arms
around his head like a windmill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up! He&rsquo;s wigwagging!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Banked to an angle of 45 degrees, Bill kept
the plane describing a tight circle directly
above the garage, spelling out Mr. Evans&rsquo;
signals the while. Presently he waved his
understanding of the message, leveled his
wings and neutralizing his ailerons, headed
the plane out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What did he say?&rdquo;
piped Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His exact words,&rdquo; returned Bill patiently,
&ldquo;were &lsquo;Park plane Clayton. Walk back after
dark. Enter through garage.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why on earth are we shooting off in
the opposite direction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, young Master Mind, it&rsquo;s a lead-pipe
cinch we&rsquo;re being watched&mdash;from the
woods, probably. Maybe they&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re
out for a transatlantic record&mdash;I hope so. The
last place we want them to think of at the
present time in connection with this plane is
Clayton!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Bill kept the amphibian headed out to sea
for the next half hour. Convinced at last
that they were well beyond the ken of Mr.
Evans&rsquo; enemies, he banked to starboard and
headed his airbus on a course at right angles
to the last leg. He continued to fly in this
direction for some twenty miles, then turned
back toward the coast again.</p>
<p>When at last they passed over the shore
line once more, it was at a point thirty miles
along the coast from Twin Heads and the
Evans house. Bill steered his craft inland,
turned right again and came in sight of their
destination as the hands of his wristwatch
marked ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clayton has a small airport,&rdquo; said Charlie
tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for that! If you&rsquo;d told me before,
you&rsquo;d have saved me some worry. The
last thing we want to do is to advertise the
<i>Loening</i> in this neck of the woods. If we&rsquo;d
had to come down in a farmer&rsquo;s meadow, it
would have been all over town in half an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>They were over the landing field now, and
as Bill circled the plane, preparatory to their
descent, he saw that it was little more than
a meadow, a mile out of town, with hangar
capable of housing three or four planes. The
flat roof of this building was painted black.
Large block letters in white paint proclaimed
the legend</p>
<p class="center">PARKER&rsquo;S AIRDROME
<br />CLAYTON ME.</p>
<p>Near the highway that led into the town,
and separated from the landing field by a
white picket fence, stood a small farmhouse.
As Bill swung his bus into the wind and nosed
over, he saw a man open the gate in the fence
and walk toward the hangar.</p>
<p>The wheels of the <i>Loening&rsquo;s</i> retractable
landing gear touched the ground. The plane
rolled forward, and came to a stop on the concrete
apron of the hangar, before its open
doors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very pretty, very pretty indeed!&rdquo; remarked
the individual who had come through
the gate. He was a tall, rangy man of about
thirty, wearing overalls much the worse for
grease and hard usage.</p>
<p>Bill and Charlie climbed down and walked
over to him. &ldquo;Good morning, and thanks,&rdquo;
smiled Bill. &ldquo;My name is Bolton. Mr.
Parker, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It pays to advertise,&rdquo; grinned the lanky
individual, and he gripped Bill&rsquo;s extended
hand with a horny fist. &ldquo;Parker&rsquo;s the name.
I guess, by the way you brought that <i>Loening</i>
down, it isn&rsquo;t flight instruction you&rsquo;re after!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;not this time. What I
need is gas and oil and a place to park the bus
for a few days. Can you fix me up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure can, Mister. Business round here
this summer is deader than a doornail. Specially
in my line. Want the bus filled up,
looked over and put shipshape, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. One of her plugs is carbonized
a bit. I&rsquo;d attend to it myself, only I&rsquo;m too
sleepy. We&rsquo;ve been in the air most of the
night. Anywhere we can turn in for a few
hours? Our friends don&rsquo;t expect us till this
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can rent you the spare room over
to the house for as long as you want it. And
how about something to eat before you turn
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead me to it,&rdquo; Charlie spoke up for the
first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; Parker chuckled. &ldquo;Come
on, Mrs. P. will be glad to dish up something
tasty for you fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Parker homestead proved to be as neat
and clean as a new pin. Mrs. Parker, a buxom
young woman with dimples and a jolly smile,
served the hungry lads with wheatcakes and
coffee until they couldn&rsquo;t eat another mouthful.
Then she led them upstairs to the low-ceiled
bedroom, where two white beds invited
them to rest. She promised to call them at
seven that evening and left them. Five minutes
later, Bill and Charlie were sound asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;time to get up!&rdquo; called
a cheery voice which Bill sleepily realized
was Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, thanks,&rdquo; he called back. &ldquo;Be
down in a jiffy. And would it be too much
trouble to fix us a couple of sandwiches before
we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ezra and I,&rdquo; said Mrs. Parker from the
other side of the closed door, &ldquo;figured as how
you&rsquo;d be wanting something. We&rsquo;re waitin&rsquo;
supper for you. And there&rsquo;s a showerbath at
the end of the hall&mdash;plenty of hot water if
you want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly do,&rdquo; called Bill, &ldquo;thanks a
lot, Mrs. Parker. We&rsquo;ll make it snappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned over and picked up a rubber
sneaker. A moment later it bounced off of
Charlie&rsquo;s red head, effectually bringing that
young man back from dreamland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Supper with the Parkers was a pleasant
affair. When it was over Bill had some little
trouble to make Mrs. Parker accept payment
for their entertainment. He guessed, however,
that their financial condition was none
of the best, so when she asked him if a dollar
would be too much, he pressed a five-spot on
the astonished young matron and refused to
take change. While he went out to assist
Parker in an inspection of the <i>Loening</i>, Charlie,
not to be outdone in gallantry, insisted on
helping wash the dishes.</p>
<p>Out in the hangar, Bill came to a decision
on a question he had been considering
throughout the meal. Ezra Parker and his
pretty wife were an honest, wholesome pair.
He needed someone in Clayton whom he could
trust and so he came at once to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker, I need a friend,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;I dare say you aren&rsquo;t averse to making
some extra money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ezra smiled and laid a hand on his shoulder.
&ldquo;I liked you the minute I set eyes on you this
morning, Bill,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I guess there
need be no mention of money in our friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. But this friendship has a
job attached to it, and you told me when I
landed, that business was none too good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a fact, boy. Mrs. P. and I
have had a hard time to make both ends meet
this summer. Anything short of robbery or
murder with a dollar or two tacked onto it
will be a godsend. Our savings are tied up in
this little property and we hate to give up.
But there&rsquo;s been mighty little joy-flying or
anything else in this line of business since the
depression. It&rsquo;s beginning to look as if we&rsquo;d
have to let the place go unless something turns
up soon. So I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m not anxious to
make some ready money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This job,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;is worth five hundred
a month, but you&rsquo;d be expected to keep
a closed head about anything that might come
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ezra stared at him in amazement. &ldquo;You
a millionaire in disguise?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;only a midshipman on summer vacation.
But Mr. Evans has plenty, and he is
going to pay your salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! you&rsquo;re the guy that put the lid on
von Hiemskirk and his pirates over to Twin
Heads harbor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I helped some,&rdquo; Bill admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say you did! What&rsquo;s this job&mdash;more
pirates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. To be truthful, the
whole thing is much of a mystery to me so
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ezra affirmed, &ldquo;I never earned
five hundred a month in my life. One month&rsquo;s
work will put Mrs. P. and me on velvet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then listen!&rdquo; Bill gave him a sketch
of affairs to date.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know the place Mr. Evans bought,&rdquo;
said Ezra when he&rsquo;d finished. &ldquo;Used to belong
to old Job Turner who died last year.
They say there&rsquo;s secret rooms, underground
passages and all manner of queer things about
that house. I expect it&rsquo;s all lies&mdash;but no telling.
Mr. Evans can&rsquo;t be up against that
Hiemskirk gang. The government cleaned
them up good and plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s up against somebody equally
unpleasant. I&rsquo;ve had a taste of them already.
Are you really game for the job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure am. What do you want me to do
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ezra took the money, albeit reluctantly.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this for?&rdquo; he asked, counting the
bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oil, gas, your time on the bus and two
weeks&rsquo; salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s dangerous, carrying
a roll that would choke a horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the habit of it,&rdquo; laughed Bill.
&ldquo;It was a birthday present from my father.
Don&rsquo;t worry, Mr. Evans will reimburse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But maybe,&rdquo; suggested Ezra doubtfully,
&ldquo;he may not be strong on the deal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;He asked for my help,&rdquo; returned Bill,
&ldquo;and this is part of it. You&rsquo;ve got a car of
some sort about the place, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of some sort&rsquo; describes it. Want me to
run you over to Turner&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but only to where the Turner road
branches out of the one to Twin Heads Harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, Bill. Before we start, hadn&rsquo;t you
better tell me what you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can talk about that on the way over,&rdquo;
said his young employer. &ldquo;While you&rsquo;re
dragging out the fliv. or the Chev. or whatever
it is, I&rsquo;ll get hold of Charlie and say goodbye
to Mrs. Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ezra chuckled. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be some happy girl
when I tell her what you&rsquo;ve done. The three
of us will get kissed good and proper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind, if you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; laughed
Bill, and went toward the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="sc">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="small">STRANGE DOINGS AT TURNER&rsquo;S</span></h2>
<p>The flivver pulled up at the side of the
dirt road and stopped. Ezra Parker, behind
the wheel, switched off the motor and likewise
the lights. Patches of moonlight filtered
through interlocking branches that arched
the grassgrown highway. These silvery
patches seemed but to deepen the velvety black
of the woods. After the noisy chugging of
four ancient cylinders the silence of the forest
was oppressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder&rsquo;s the road to Turner&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Ezra
volunteered, pointing toward a narrow track,
choked with weeds, which led off to the right.
&ldquo;The house is two or three miles farther on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know! I&rsquo;ve been over it twice in a car&mdash;and
gee whiz!&mdash;it sure is a tough one to
drive,&rdquo; piped Charlie from the back seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to hop it now,&rdquo; said Bill.
&ldquo;Hand me the extra rifle, and come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Followed by young Evans, he stepped down
to the roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long, fellows,&rdquo; Ezra bade them, &ldquo;better
watch your step when you get near Turner&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; returned Bill. &ldquo;Got the times
fixed in your mind, Ezra, and all the rest of
the instructions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet. I&rsquo;ll write them down soon as I
get home. Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t let you fellows
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He backed the car across the road, swung
round his front wheels and chugged off in
the direction of Clayton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Dad will approve,&rdquo; said Charlie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s face took, on a look of grim determination
in the darkness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just too bad if he
doesn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t shoulder that rifle, Charlie.
It&rsquo;s likely to hit a branch and go off. Hold
it in the hollow of your arm, like I&rsquo;m carrying
mine. Keep three or four paces behind
me&mdash;and remember, no more talking until
we are inside the garage. If you see me drop
down&mdash;flop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.&rdquo; grunted the youngster. &ldquo;On your
way. If anybody spots us it won&rsquo;t be my
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They strode down the road toward Turner&rsquo;s
for a mile or more. Neither the tall lad nor
the short one uttered a word. Bill drank in
the crisp, cool night air, pleasant after the
dusty highway. On either hand dense woods
shut out the moonlight. Directly overhead,
however, light filtered between the treetops,
flecking the overgrown trail with splotches of
silver.</p>
<p>When they came to an open woodlot, Bill
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think from what Ezra said, we go
to the left here. We&rsquo;ll see where it lands us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Shortly after passing round the field, a
dense wood of pines showed up against the
moonlight on their right hand. Between
them and the pines was a broad stone fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hang out here for a few minutes,&rdquo;
Bill remarked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like making
quite certain. If you hear anyone following,
Charlie, it means we were noticed in the
car, and we&rsquo;re probably in for a rousing time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After an interval he got up and stretched
himself, gave a curt order and plunged abruptly
into the heart of the woods. Bill had
no idea how far they penetrated, but they
appeared to go forward for a good fifteen
minutes before they struck upon a grassgrown
avenue or drive among the trees, and
at the end of it they saw a clearing. Both
lads stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>A gentle wind stirred in the tree-tops, and
above its rustle, they suddenly heard the soft
wash of the sea. Bill turned and Charlie followed
his gaze. Set back, quite close to the
woods, amid overgrown lawns and shrubbery,
there glimmered in the pallid moonlight, the
outlines of a house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turner&rsquo;s!&rdquo; whispered Bill as Charlie
came close. &ldquo;It looked different from the
air, but I guess it&rsquo;s the place, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;and there&rsquo;s the garage, see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emerging stealthily from the trees, he
quickly glanced about, crossed the path, cut
in behind a screen of shrubbery and made his
way round the side of the house to the garage.
Without hesitation he went forward, pulled
the right hand door slightly ajar and slipped
in, with Charlie at his heels. The darkness
closed in upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, and I&rsquo;ll be with you,&rdquo; a
cautious voice spoke nearby, and Bill recognized
it as Mr. Evans&rsquo;. The door behind
them shut with a slight click, and Bill felt
one of his hands caught in a firm grasp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie, take Bill&rsquo;s other hand. We
won&rsquo;t show a light just yet. Come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed on until they came to what
Bill decided was a closet in one corner of the
garage. He heard Mr. Evans open a door,
and at the same time he spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut the door after you, Charlie, and see
that the lock snaps. There are twelve steps
down, Bill. Come along&mdash;the youngster
knows his way from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill, still grasping Mr. Evans&rsquo; hand, felt
for the first step, found it and descended after
his guide. On level ground once more, he
counted eighty-four paces and two turns in
the dark tunnel before he was led up a flight
of twenty-two steps at the farther end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>There came a pause, followed by a click.
Then he was pulled gently forward and his
hand released. He waited; then a leaping
shaft of light from a single unshaded lamp
disclosed a large and soundly furnished room,
with books lining the walls and deep armchairs
grouped about. On a table in the center
were a large plate of sandwiches, some
glasses and several bottles of ginger ale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me for that!&rdquo; cried Charlie, his face
shining in anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy&rsquo;s head is in his stomach,&rdquo; declared
Mr. Evans. &ldquo;But I suppose at his age
I was always hungry too. Well, I&rsquo;m glad to
see both of you. I need your help, Bill, because
I can&rsquo;t drag in the police on this matter&mdash;at
least, not yet. They would spoil everything.
Help yourself from the table, lad,
before Charlie gobbles all the sandwiches.
Then tell me about your trip. Something
happen to the car? Or did you think your
plane would prove the more useful?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said Bill from the table, where he
was pouring himself a glass of ginger ale.
Taking a couple of sandwiches, he went over
to an armchair and sank back in its comfortable
depths. &ldquo;Your friends, or enemies, or
whoever they are,&rdquo; he went on, munching as
he talked, &ldquo;are quite active around New
Canaan. They made things hum for a while,
and wrecked your car into the bargain. If
their shooting hadn&rsquo;t been putrid, you&rsquo;d be
minus a son now, Mr. Evans. It&rsquo;s not my
place to criticize, but don&rsquo;t you think it was
pretty risky, sending a boy his age on such a
dangerous undertaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Evans started up from his chair in
consternation. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean they tried
to shoot the boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do mean just that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father put an arm about his son&rsquo;s
shoulders and held him close. &ldquo;The devils!&rdquo;
he muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea they would dare
resort to such methods! If I had, he never
would have been sent. And I don&rsquo;t blame
you, Bill, for thinking me a heartless parent.
If anything had happened to this boy&mdash;&mdash;But
there&rsquo;s no sense in making excuses now.
Tell me just what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>He carted Charlie, sandwiches and ginger
ale over to his chair and deposited them there,
seating himself on the broad arm at his son&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the first I knew of it,&rdquo; began Bill,
and continued with a recitation of their adventures
since the thunderstorm had awakened
him the night before. When he had
finished, he got up to replenish his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid! I&rsquo;m extremely proud of you
both. Now tell me of the arrangements
you&rsquo;ve made with Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starting tomorrow night, he is to fly the
<i>Loening</i> over this property. If he sees a light
in the garage he will know that we want him.
He will then continue on his way out to sea
for a few miles, come back over Twin Heads
and land in the harbor near the channel that
leads out to the Atlantic. We will get in
touch with him there. In any case, unless he
is molested, he is to wait on the water until
daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we do not need him, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the garage will be dark, and he&rsquo;ll
go out to sea, swing round and go back to
Clayton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you arrange any set time for his
flights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Tomorrow he will be over this house
at midnight. The next night at one o&rsquo;clock.
The night after, at two, and the following
one at three. Then he starts all over again.
I arranged his trips in that order, so that anyone
spying would not be able to count on a set
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Evans nodded his approval. &ldquo;That
is very satisfactory, Bill. You think Parker
is to be trusted, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it, sir. Hope you don&rsquo;t think
I set his salary at too high a figure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll double it if he proves useful,&rdquo; Mr.
Evans declared. &ldquo;Now get off my knee,
Charlie, while I pay Bill back for what he
has spent on my account.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>He dug into a trousers&rsquo; pocket, fished out
a roll of bills and handed it to Bill. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I owe you&mdash;and keep the balance for
expenses. You may need it before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, sir.&rdquo; Bill pocketed the money.
&ldquo;Can you tell us something of what we&rsquo;re up
against, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Evans glanced at his watch. &ldquo;Goodness!
It&rsquo;s time you fellows were in bed. I&rsquo;ll
go into details, Bill, after breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dad, we slept all day!&rdquo; Charlie expostulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, son. You won&rsquo;t be the worse
for a few hours more. We&rsquo;ll all need clear
wits in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beckoning the lads to follow, he went to
the door. Their feet echoed on the polished
tiles of the hall, a vast place which looked
like a black cavern above them, the dim shape
of a wide staircase beyond. Following Mr.
Evans&rsquo; lead, they mounted the stairs, his flashlight
flickering on the thick carpet and heavy
oak banisters. In the corridor above, he
stopped and flung open a door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>They entered a large, square bedroom.
Twin beds stood against opposite walls, and
heavy dark hangings concealed the windows.
These curtains, Mr. Evans drew back, and
through the shutters there gleamed the faint
gray light of a waning moon. A solitary
night-owl made eerie music in the
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep well,&rdquo; said Charlie&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
call you two at seven. We&rsquo;ll have breakfast
and I&rsquo;ll explain my problem to you. Good
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Evans departed with a wave of his
hand. &ldquo;I forgot to say,&rdquo; he added, putting
his head inside the door again, &ldquo;if you wake
earlier than seven, don&rsquo;t raise a row. No
bursting into happy song, Charlie....&rdquo; He
grinned at his son, nodded, and was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Bill sat down on his bed and took off his
shoes. &ldquo;I wonder why he warned us about
noise,&rdquo; he remarked as he struggled with a
knot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me something easy,&rdquo; yawned Charlie.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon find out that there&rsquo;s more hush
stuff about this house than there is at a
funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheerful simile!&rdquo; grunted Bill. He
dropped a shoe, stripped off his outer garments,
and got into bed wearing his underclothes.</p>
<p>He was dreaming of masked foes, who
kept climbing up from airy depths, to creep
on him unawares, when one of these fiends
clutched him by the shoulder. Suddenly he
found himself sitting up in bed, shaking with
the terror of nightmare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you dead&mdash;or what?&rdquo; Charlie stood
beside him, and leaned over to shake him
again. Through partly opened shutters daylight
streamed into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake,&rdquo; said Bill with an effort.
&ldquo;What time is it, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
worried. I just woke up myself&mdash;Dad hasn&rsquo;t
called us or come near us yet. Do you s&rsquo;pose
something has happened to him, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill jumped out of bed. &ldquo;Wait till I get
some clothes on&mdash;then we&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="sc">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="small">WATCHERS IN THE TREES</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s room?&rdquo; Bill
stepped into the corridor, Charlie at his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;that one opposite&mdash;the door&rsquo;s
open. He isn&rsquo;t there&mdash;I looked before I
woke you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bed hasn&rsquo;t been slept in either&mdash;come
along downstairs. He may be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill had had an impression the night before
of the solid comfort of the house. But
it was not until they descended the great oak
staircase in the morning that he realized, in
spite of dust sheets, how exquisitely the place
was appointed. In true manorial style, armor
hung in the hall, marble busts gleamed
against the dark, beautifully carved panelling,
and half a dozen riding crops dangled
from a pair of antlers over the low fireplace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Here Charlie took the lead. They went
first to the library, with its secret door in the
panelling, through which they had entered
the house from the garage. A flashlight lay
on the table, amongst the remains of the
sandwiches. Bill appropriated it, and after
Charlie had opened the sliding door by twisting
a knob on the fireplace, they investigated
the tunnel and its outlet. But the garage and
the underground passage were empty of any
human being.</p>
<p>They returned to the library, and made a
round of the rooms on that floor; a small den,
two large living rooms, and a dining room.
All the furniture was shrouded in dust covers.
The rooms looked gloomy and un-lived-in.
Scarcely any light came through the closed
shutters. Bill&rsquo;s feeble flashlight seemed to
accentuate the cavernous depths of the huge
apartments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>A back passage led them to the pantry and
immense, stone-floored kitchen. On a table
near the sink, an unwashed plate and cup
told the story of eggs and coffee.</p>
<p>Bill turned to the boy. &ldquo;There! On a
bet, he ate and went out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better go over the rest of the
house, though?&rdquo; There was a slight tremor
in Charlie&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;This place is creepy.
It was like that when I was here before. I
never open a door but what I expect a dead
man to walk out on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; laughed Bill, &ldquo;would take some
doing! You&rsquo;ll be telling me the house is
haunted, next!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t no such animals
as ghosts. You&rsquo;re losing your nerve, kid.
You probably heard a rat in the walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rat, nothing! If it wasn&rsquo;t a ghost, who
was in our room just before daylight? It
wasn&rsquo;t Dad. I called and the figure just
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Um&mdash;that&rsquo;s funny. Perhaps some friend
of your father&rsquo;s&mdash;and they went off together
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie shook his head solemnly. &ldquo;Dad
hasn&rsquo;t any friends up here, Bill, or he
wouldn&rsquo;t have had to call on you. But suppose
it was a friend he went away with, why
didn&rsquo;t he let us know? I&rsquo;ll just bet Dad&rsquo;s in
this house right now. Down cellar or upstairs,
with his throat cut, like as not!&rdquo;
Charlie was in tears now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, here, now! Stop it! You certainly
are a cheerful kid this morning&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think!&rdquo; Bill scoffed, and patted him
on the back. &ldquo;Detective thrillers and too
much food are what ails you. Imagination
plus indigestion will make anybody see or
hear a lot of things. How do I get down to
the cellar? If you&rsquo;re afraid of meeting more
spooks, you&rsquo;d better stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; replied Charlie
so hurriedly that Bill burst out laughing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then, big boy.&rdquo; Charlie&rsquo;s
mournful face made him feel ashamed of his
mirth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this big lonely house
any more than you do, but we&rsquo;ll go down into
the cellar just the same, although I haven&rsquo;t
the slightest doubt but that your father left
this place hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An inspection of the cellars and the two
upper stories proved conclusively to Bill that
except for themselves, there was nobody in
the house. However, they found food and
plenty of it in the storage rooms. A whole
closet full of canned goods, eggs, bread and
a couple of hams and four or five slabs of
bacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old man, let&rsquo;s have a shower,&rdquo; suggested
Bill, &ldquo;and then I&rsquo;ll rustle some breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Charlie smiled and turned on a tap at the
kitchen sink. A faint trickle came from the
faucet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get no shower, or bath while
you&rsquo;re in this house,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;The
water comes from a well and there&rsquo;s something
wrong with the pump. Dad says the
water supply is likely to give out any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill made a grimace. &ldquo;How do you take
baths then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was here before we went down
to the cove&mdash;but never until after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! A swim is just what I need.
I tell you what, Charlie! We&rsquo;ll have something
to eat, take a more careful look for any
message your father may have left and then
we&rsquo;ll romp down to that cove of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay by me, Bill. Let&rsquo;s get the grub.
I could eat a horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Bill snorted as
they started after the food.</p>
<p>When they had eaten and washed up at
the kitchen sink, Bill instituted a thorough
search for the message in their bedroom and
in the library.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;there just
isn&rsquo;t any message, and that&rsquo;s that. I vote we
pop down to the cove and have our dip now.
Is it much of a jaunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; Charlie turned from peering
through the curtains at the sunshine. &ldquo;We
can get into the shrubbery at the back door
and keep under cover pretty well all the
time. We&rsquo;ll be taking chances, though. Dad
wouldn&rsquo;t let us go until after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; Bill said casually.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for a swim. You can stay here,
though, if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; declared the boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather
be shot than stay in this house alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do we go from the grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right through the trees until we come
to a rough sort of lane. It leads from the
main road down to a little bay that&rsquo;s just the
place for a swim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. Now, listen to me, kid. If we
happen to run into anybody and can&rsquo;t make a
bunk without being seen, we&rsquo;ll go right up
and speak to them openly. There&rsquo;s no sense in
arousing suspicions&mdash;or showing that we have
any! We&rsquo;ll say we&rsquo;re on a walking tour
along the coast, and saw the lane leading
down to the sea&mdash;savez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You betcha! And, oh, Bill, I forgot to
say that we can&rsquo;t swim out far. Dad told me
that the currents round the point are the
dickens and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armed with towels and soap, they let
themselves out by the back door and darted
into the bushes. With Charlie in the lead,
they pushed through the trees, keeping a
sharp lookout. Presently they reached the
lane, and, without sighting a single creature,
they found themselves on the beach.</p>
<p>The sand shelved down into a little bay
which was about a hundred yards across.
Great rocks crowded down into the water on
either side. The place was embowered in
trees and bushes. It was an ideal spot for a
quiet dip. Both lads slipped off their clothes
and entered the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The sea was perfect. Charlie, who wasn&rsquo;t
much on aquatics, paddled about near shore,
but Bill soon found himself at the mouth of
the bay. Swimming strongly, with an easy
crawl stroke, he revelled in the electric chill
of the water and the cloudless sky and sunshine.
A short distance ahead of him, a huge
brown rock jutted up from the water like a
buoy. He swam to it and clambered up on its
groined shoulder, slippery with endless laving
of the sea. Standing upright, he gazed about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Up and down the beach, the tumbled rocks
were belted with trees for some miles. Beyond
the trees, so far as he could see, were the
bare, sharp outlines of tall cliffs overhanging
the water. Picturesque enough, thought
Bill, but immeasurably lonesome. Out to sea
an island lay off the coast, a mile, perhaps two
miles away. He could not judge accurately,
for it is difficult to decide distance from the
level of the water. He remembered seeing it
the day before, from the air. As he remembered
it, it was a small, rocky, barren-looking
place, with a single house on it, though he
hadn&rsquo;t been absolutely certain about the
house. He stared in that direction for a
minute or two. As he turned about, ready to
dive in and return to shore, there was a sharp
thud on the rock at his feet.</p>
<p>Bill looked down, but saw nothing&mdash;The
next moment he heard, or imagined he heard,
something go past his ear with a whistling
sound. He gazed toward the beach, more
than a little disturbed. Nothing could be
seen but Charlie sitting naked on the sand.
There was no stir of bush, not a movement of
grass. And yet again above his head&mdash;and
this time closer&mdash;there was a harsh <i>z-z-z-p</i>!
of a bullet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Bill heard no sound of an explosion, but
suddenly he saw Charlie spring to his feet,
snatch up his clothes and dart into the underbrush.
The only conclusion he could reach,
as he stood on the sea-washed rock, hurriedly
collecting his thoughts, was that someone
concealed ashore was shooting at him with a
powerful air-gun.</p>
<p>Without a second&rsquo;s further hesitation, he
flopped into the water. He had intended to
swim back to the little bay, but now he
hastily changed his mind. To return in that
direction while the bullets were flying was
like asking for a sudden and unpleasant end to
his existence. So he struck out to sea, meaning
to make a detour and go ashore at some
secluded spot a little further down the coast.</p>
<p>He was swimming with his head submerged
in the water, in order to conceal his
whereabouts if possible from the beach.
When he turned on his back to take his bearings,
he remembered Charlie&rsquo;s warning about
the current. It seemed to him as he glanced
back to the rock where he had stood, that he
had covered a great distance in a very short
time, even allowing for the extra speed due to
his excitement and wrath over the unknown
marksman&rsquo;s attempt to drop him in the water
with a bullet. He fixed his eyes on a point
on the shore and struck out with all his might.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>At first Bill could not believe that his
tremendous efforts were achieving&mdash;nothing.
But gradually, after a fierce fight of more
than a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s duration, the truth
broke upon him. His distance from the
beach was not lessening at all, but was swiftly
increasing. He could battle as he liked
against it, but the tide was stronger, stronger
than he. There was no shadow of doubt in
his mind that he was being carried out to sea.</p>
<p>It was difficult to meet the situation calmly,
but Bill tried to quiet the surge of pain that
was sucking the strength from his limbs. It
looked as though only a miracle would save
him now. He turned on his back, and for a
moment a ray of hope sent a warm glow
through his veins. He was being borne out
on the tide, toward the island! It might be
possible to force a landing there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Now that seemed his only prospect of life.
With all the vigor he could summon, Bill
struck across the current. But when he
paused in exhaustion to observe his progress,
he saw that it was useless. He had already
been swept past the island. It was out of his
range.</p>
<p>Wearily, Bill shut his eyes, gasping for
breath, and felt the power melting away from
his numbed limbs. Then hazily he noticed
that the island seemed nearer&mdash;or was that
but a last illusion before the end? No! The
rocks were towering above him. He realized
that he had been swept around on the current
to the seaward side, and that the mainland was
out of sight. With his last atom of strength,
he tried to strike out toward that shore, but
the place seemed to be slipping away from
him again. There was a throbbing in his
ears, growing louder and louder. A vague,
dreamlike impression of touching the gray
side of some craft&mdash;then his senses left him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">THE MYSTERIOUS TRIO</span></h2>
<p>The whitewashed wooden walls of a hut,
and a sickly sting of brandy in his throat,
were Bill&rsquo;s first impressions of life on
awakening. An old brown face with blue
eyes and a tuft of white beard below the chin
looked down at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re better,&rdquo; the man said grimly.
&ldquo;But I caught sight of you none too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; Bill managed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Drink this.&rdquo; As the
man lifted a tin of boiling coffee from a little
stove, Bill saw that he was lean and lanky
and dressed in a sailor&rsquo;s blue jersey and top-boots.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s heat you need, not information.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Bill sat up. A warm sweater and flannel
trousers now covered him, and by the time he
had finished the coffee, he felt more like
taking a sane interest in his surroundings. He
was about to try to express his thanks to the
old man when there was a knock on the door.
The old fellow opened the door and stepped
outside.</p>
<p>A girl stood in the doorway. She was
dressed in a white skirt and sweater. She
had a smooth olive skin and her black hair was
cut close to her head. Bill decided that she
was pretty, and that she must be about sixteen.
Her eyes were smiling at him as he got
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; she cried, for Bill was
gripping a beam at his side to steady himself.
&ldquo;Why, you must be feeling perfectly dreadful!
Aren&rsquo;t you hungry? Won&rsquo;t you let me
get you something to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Bill was sure he detected the faintest
shadow of a foreign accent in her speech. He
smiled. &ldquo;In a little while, perhaps, thank
you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My head is a bit on the blink.
I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll ever be able to thank
that old man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim won&rsquo;t want any thanks. He&rsquo;ll
be offended if you try to thank him. He saw
you from the motor-boat. He&rsquo;s a gruff old
tar, but he&rsquo;s as good as gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was lucky for me that there was somebody
here&mdash;I suppose I&rsquo;m on the island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are. There&rsquo;s the beach where Jim
brought you in.&rdquo; She pointed through the
open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you yachting up this way?&rdquo; ventured
Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, no!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;I
live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Live</i> here?&rdquo; Bill repeated in astonishment.
&ldquo;Why in the world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed softly. &ldquo;Well, I suppose I
like it. I have a bungalow back in the hollow.
This is really Jim&rsquo;s bunk. He sleeps in
there. But you haven&rsquo;t told me about yourself.
Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The innocent question caught Bill up
short. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m on a walking tour,&rdquo; he said
as steadily as he could, then smiled wanly at
his joke. &ldquo;I&mdash;I went down to the shore for
a swim and that confounded current got me.
I thought I was bound for Davy Jones, all
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you go for a bath?&rdquo; she asked
anxiously, it seemed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a little bay at the end of a lane
off the main road to Clayton. And the sea
looked so tempting I couldn&rsquo;t resist it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;did you see anybody in the
woods as you came along?&rdquo; She gave him a
quick glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul. If I&rsquo;d drowned, my clothes
would have lain on the shore for weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely old place,
Turner&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she remarked casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so that is its name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen it then&mdash;the house among
the trees?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I came past it, you know,&rdquo; he dissembled.
&ldquo;I got only a glimpse of it....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked at him sharply, the carefree
expression gone from her eyes. She
stared at him for several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been on your walking
tour?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about a week,&rdquo; he answered easily.
&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drew herself up. &ldquo;I want to
know the truth!&rdquo; Her voice sounded a challenge.
&ldquo;Your name is Harold Johnson, and
you flew up here night before last from
Stamford, Connecticut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill was astounded. Still limp and sick
from his exertions in the water, this declaration&mdash;half
truth that it was&mdash;literally took his
breath away. Of course she was mistaken in
the name, but Stamford is only five or six
miles from New Canaan. Did she take him
for someone else, or had she only got the name
wrong? In either case, would it be wise to
reveal his real identity? What if she were
one of those working against Mr. Evans?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Yet she was but a young girl and these
enemies of Charlie&rsquo;s father had already
proven themselves to be villains of the first
water. Weak as he was, Bill&rsquo;s brain was unable
to cope with the problem. His bewilderment
was evidently clearly written on his
face, for he could see a slow smile appearing
in the girl&rsquo;s eyes as she stood in the doorway
and looked down on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice you don&rsquo;t deny it, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo;
she remarked abruptly.</p>
<p>Bill shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the good
of denying it,&rdquo; he replied quietly. &ldquo;You appear
to know all about me. But as a point
of interest, I&rsquo;d be glad to know how you got
your information.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt it&rsquo;s a point of great interest to
you,&rdquo; she said with deliberation. &ldquo;But you
really can&rsquo;t expect me to answer that question.
To tell the truth, I was a little doubtful about
you at first&mdash;I only mentioned your name to
make quite certain who you were. But now
we know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but you go too fast!&rdquo; She took a
step nearer and her voice softened. &ldquo;Mr.
Johnson, why did you decide to come to
Maine? Do you really think it is going to
bring you luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill looked at her closely, unable to decide
what was in her mind. Perhaps her object
was to sound him delicately on how much he
really knew. He did not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she went on, and her tone was low
and serious, &ldquo;if I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t be
too sure about that luck. Some things, you
know, are better left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I don&rsquo;t get you,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet my meaning is perfectly plain.
If you only knew what you are up against, you
would not complicate your affairs by&mdash;well,
by taking on another risk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Bill had not the slightest idea what this
dark-eyed girl was driving at. He couldn&rsquo;t
give anything away. Mr. Evans&rsquo; plans&mdash;the
very nature of this mysterious business he
had dropped into with the thunderstorm was
still an unsolved enigma, so far as he was concerned.</p>
<p>This girl, no matter who she was, appeared
to be conversant with details of the situation.
If he continued to play Mr. Johnson, in
whom she seemed vastly interested, some real
news might pop out unawares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another risk?&rdquo; he repeated, taking up
the threat of her last remark. &ldquo;What if I
say I don&rsquo;t mind taking risks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson, you talk lightly because you
do not know. It is one thing to keep out of
the hands of the police, but if you knew the
truth about your new venture&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Bill began to think that she was older than
he first surmised. Her eyes were half closed,
and the curves of her mouth had moulded
into a firm line. It gave him quite a shock
of surprise to see that look on her face&mdash;a
look of grim defiance, the look of one who
would not hesitate to shoot, and shoot straight,
in an extremity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind risks? Well, Mr. Johnson,
you&rsquo;ll have risks in plenty before you&rsquo;re
much older!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill smiled. &ldquo;Maybe. But I&rsquo;ll never have
a closer shave than I had this morning. You
must admit that. If you and old Jim hadn&rsquo;t
been on this island, I should have gone under
for keeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it any more,&rdquo; said the girl.
Her expression changed and a gentler note
came into her voice. &ldquo;Try to get some sleep.
That&rsquo;s what you need more than anything else
at present. In a few hours I&rsquo;ll bring you
something to eat and you&rsquo;ll feel better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind, and I&rsquo;ll never be able
to thank you properly. But, really, if you
could see your way to help me get back to the
mainland quickly, I&rsquo;d be more than obliged.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear of it.
You&rsquo;re not fit for any such thing. I insist on
your having some sleep first. Perhaps you
don&rsquo;t realize it, but you&rsquo;re still looking dreadfully
white and shaky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill saw that there was nothing to do but
comply with her orders, so he lay down again
on the cot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now I must
go. I&rsquo;ll be back later on and I hope you&rsquo;ll be
comfortable in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she went out and shut the door.
Bill heard a click. She had turned the key in
the lock! He started up at the sound, but
dropped back, a faint smile on his lips. If
she wanted to be sure that he kept to the
hut&mdash;well, that was her business. He was,
to all purposes, a prisoner anyway, lock or no
lock. Unless he could get hold of a boat,
there would be no leaving the island. Swimming
was out of the question. One try at the
currents surrounding this rocky shore was
quite enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>But who were this girl and the old man?
She said she lived here&mdash;but that could mean
anything. Had Charlie been able to get
back to the house? The youngster evidently
hated the spooky place. Would he stay there,
now that he was alone? With these thoughts
buzzing through his tired brain, Bill fell into
sleep.</p>
<p>He awoke to find the girl at his side,
bearing a tray filled with food. What hour
it was he could not tell, and at the moment he
did not inquire. His main obsessions now
were a racking thirst and an ardent hunger
for food. He&rsquo;d had nothing to eat since
early morning, and the chops, fried potatoes
and tea, with brown bread and honey, tasted
delicious. While he did justice to the fare,
the girl sat on a packing case in the doorway,
chatting inconsequentially.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>When the last morsel of his meal had disappeared,
Bill thanked her again. Then he
rose to his feet, determined to bring matters
to a head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t put you to any inconvenience,&rdquo;
he said quietly, &ldquo;but I will take it
as a favor if you&rsquo;ll help me get back to the
mainland now. Please don&rsquo;t think I haven&rsquo;t
appreciated your hospitality. You have been
more than kind to me. But you understand it
is vitally important for me to get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;your walking tour is so important
as all that?&rdquo; She cast an amused glance up
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Bill met her look firmly.
&ldquo;If you will be good enough to give orders
for the boat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; she said
slowly, &ldquo;that that is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible? You mean there&rsquo;s no way of
getting across? I thought you said something
about a motor boat&mdash;has anything gone
wrong with it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that, Mr. Johnson. I mean
that you must remain here. To be frank&mdash;I
have my instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instructions! And from whom?&rdquo; he demanded
curtly.</p>
<p>The girl looked at him steadily. &ldquo;You
must not ask. It is too late now for you to
back out. You should have thought of the
risks you ran before you came up here on this
errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to back out of anything,&rdquo;
he exclaimed shortly. &ldquo;And as for risks, I
told you before that I am willing to take
them. But my mind is made up on one
thing&mdash;I&rsquo;m going back to the mainland
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made as if to pass her in the doorway.</p>
<p>She stepped aside, her eyes fixed smilingly
on his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish you a
pleasant swim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the motor boat,&rdquo; Bill cried, exasperated.
&ldquo;I intend to use that motor boat,
though I have to run her myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your work
cut out, Mr. Johnson. The motor boat has
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill stared at her. Then abruptly he
turned and walked out of the hut and up a
steep incline that led to the cliffs overlooking
the sea. Twenty-five feet below, deep water
swirled about its base where year in and year
out the strong current had eaten into solid
rock. He heard a footstep beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the girl, her eyes twinkling,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a dinghy locked in the boat-house!
But you can&rsquo;t break the lock, because
I tried one day when I thought I&rsquo;d lost the
key. I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Johnson, but I&rsquo;m afraid
you&rsquo;ll have to put up with my company for a
little while longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Bill did not reply. He was listening to the
unmistakable sound of a four-cylinder engine,
one of whose cylinders intermittently missed
fire. A motor boat shot round the point to
their left and swung in toward the base of the
cliff. It carried a single occupant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she comes now,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not our boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose is it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but I can guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Bill?&rdquo; shouted the man in the
motor boat.</p>
<p>Bill, to his certain knowledge, had never
laid eyes on him before. &ldquo;It sure is,&rdquo; he
shouted back. &ldquo;Will you take me across?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man seemed to hesitate. Then he
slowed down his small craft. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have
to jump, Bill,&rdquo; was what he said, using his
hands as a megaphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump, you fool&mdash;and be quick about it.&rdquo;
There was authority as well as power in the
strident tones.</p>
<p>Bill kicked off the leather moccasins he
wore, and stepped back a few paces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Harold Johnson!&rdquo; exclaimed
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never said I was,&rdquo; returned Bill. &ldquo;Sorry
to leave so hastily. But there&rsquo;s a reason.
Thanks for everything&mdash;bye-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a perfect idiot I&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Bill Bolton, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; grinned Bill and sprang toward
the edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sanders&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
kill you&mdash;<i>don&rsquo;t</i>&mdash;&rdquo; She screamed.</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s body shot through the air, and he cut
the water below in a very pretty dive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="sc">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="small">THE MAN WITH THE NERVOUS AFFLICTION</span></h2>
<p>Bill came to the surface a few yards from
the motor boat. Three or four quick strokes
brought him to the side, where with the help
of an extended hand, he clambered aboard to
face the stranger.</p>
<p>Getting back his wind, Bill took stock of
the man. His first impression had been of
his slight build, but on closer scrutiny Bill
saw that he was well-knit, with very broad
shoulders. He had a rather sallow, clean-shaven
face, with unexpectedly large and very
bright dark eyes. These eyes never left Bill
for a second as he opened the throttle and
sent the boat skimming round the end of the
island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was a very nice dive,&rdquo; the man spoke
abruptly, with a quick nod as if to emphasize
the point. &ldquo;Fond of swimming, aren&rsquo;t you?
Though not as keen on it as you were this
morning, eh?&rdquo; He grinned at what he considered
a good joke and nodded his head emphatically.</p>
<p>Bill began to realize that this continual
nodding must be a form of nervousness and
that probably the man himself was unconscious
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the lift, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Sanders?&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;Sanders is the name,&rdquo; the
man at the wheel jerked out. &ldquo;The young
lady recognized me, it seems. Needn&rsquo;t have
been so dramatic about it, though. I kind
of guessed you&rsquo;d have enough of Pig Island
by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mr. Sanders nodded, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no
reason to keep the thing a secret. I moseyed
over to the island a few hours ago. Tied up
down t&rsquo;other end from the houses. Happened
to overhear Deborah talking to old Jim.
Caught on to the fact they&rsquo;d taken you for
Slim Johnson, and that they meant to keep
you with them a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they didn&rsquo;t know you were spying?&rdquo;
The more Bill saw of his smiling, nodding
rescuer, the less he liked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it ain&rsquo;t likely I let &rsquo;em catch sight of
me! I don&rsquo;t know about the girl, but old
Jim Hancock is one of those fellers who
never misses with a rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you, I take it, Mr. Sanders, are working
for the other side in this mysterious business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> the other side, Mr. Midshipman
Bolton. What made you think I&rsquo;d want to
chum up with Evans&rsquo; secretary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evans&rsquo; secretary!&rdquo; Bill repeated in
amazement. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;that girl&mdash;Deborah&mdash;is
his secretary?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know, young man. Evans
owns Pig Island&mdash;didn&rsquo;t he tell you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders laughed sardonically and
nodded until Bill thought he would burst
a blood vessel&mdash;he hoped he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said Bill, light dawning at last,
&ldquo;you decided it would be swell to have me
throw myself into your arms, as it were. And
before those people on the island and I woke
up to the fact that we were on the same side
of the fence in this mixup!&rdquo; Mentally he
cursed himself for his impulsiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d have thought you&rsquo;d tumble so
fast?&rdquo; sneered Sanders.</p>
<p>Then as Bill made a threatening move toward
him, an automatic whipped into sight
from beneath Sanders&rsquo; armpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no you don&rsquo;t, sonny!&rdquo; he barked.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t pay you to get nasty with me. Sit
down! It&rsquo;s time you learned a few things,
you young whelp!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about that,&rdquo; Bill agreed
bitterly, looking into the blue-black muzzle
some four feet away. He bent backward as
though to sit down on the thwart, when without
warning his right leg shot out and he
planted a smashing blow with his bare foot
upon the under side of Sander&rsquo;s wrist. The
automatic flew harmlessly overside, while the
astounded man found himself seized by his
tingling wrist. His arm was jerked forward
with a suddenness that almost wrenched it
from the socket, while Bill&rsquo;s other arm
wrapped tightly about the semi-paralyzed
member. There came another wrench, and
dizzying pain, and he went headfirst out of
the boat, after his revolver. When he rose
to the surface, his craft was already some
yards away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I said before,&rdquo; Bill called to him,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. You should learn
<i>savatte</i>&mdash;the French method of foot-boxing,
you know. That arm-hold I learned among
others from a <i>jiu-jitsu</i> professor&mdash;a Jap. It
pays to have international tastes. Incidentally
I don&rsquo;t think the current is bad about here.
You&rsquo;re only about sixty yards from shore.
Cheerio&mdash;as they say in Merry England. A
pleasant swim, Mister Sanders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanders said nothing. He felt too sick
even to swear. His right arm pained him so
that he turned on his back and headed for
shore, using his left and both legs as a means
to propel his aching body.</p>
<p>Bill widened his throttle and sped up the
motor boat, keeping the shore line on his left.
A mile farther on he came to the mouth of the
cove where he had bathed with Charlie that
morning. He shut off the engine and took a
survey of his surroundings.</p>
<p>The gentle breeze had gone with the morning.
Not a branch moved, not a leaf stirred
on the trees above the rocks. Bill guessed it
must be close to seven in the evening, for the
sun was barely discernible above the woods,
and long shadows lay upon the quiet water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Next, he made a thorough inspection of
the boat which brought to light two interesting
items. In a locker forward he came upon
the clothes he had left on the beach that
morning. Bill was delighted, for this find
provided him with two things he needed
badly, shoes and a watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Beneath the clothes was a light overcoat of
covert cloth, apparently the property of
Sanders. He pulled it out and was about to
put it back again, when a thought struck him.
A closer inspection of the coat brought forth,
first, a pair of pigskin gloves, then from
the inside pocket, Bill extracted three envelopes.</p>
<p>All three of these missives bore the Stamford,
Connecticut, postmark, and all three
were addressed to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Zenas Sanders,</p>
<p class="t2">General Delivery,</p>
<p class="t4">Clayton, Maine.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Without the slightest hesitation, Bill took
the papers from the slit envelopes. Two
proved to be bills; one for repairs on a car,
the other from a tailor for three suits of
clothes. The third letter, however, was
headed &ldquo;Gring&rsquo;s Hotel, Stamford, Conn.,&rdquo;
and bore the date of three days earlier. It
ran&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Sanders&mdash;Just a line to say I have
engaged the experts as directed. Got them
in the big city and they sure do ask a big
price. But that is your business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you have located the exact position,
it either means taking the Evans&rsquo; bunch for
a ride or making a snappy job of it. Personally
I don&rsquo;t think it can be done in one
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t write any more. Both mails and
telegraph are too risky. That gink Evans is
wide awake. He&rsquo;s watching this end too&mdash;and
you know he&rsquo;s intercepted two messages
already. I know what to do, but if you must
send your fool instructions, send them by
word of mouth, or better still, fly down here
and go up with us. Then we could run in
nights and stand out to sea day times, and you
would be on board to direct operations. That
would stop Evans having you followed up
there when you join us as you must eventually.
Also if we don&rsquo;t write any more there&rsquo;ll be
no chance of his being able to get documentary
evidence. If you send a man, let
him say Zenas and nod like you. Then I&rsquo;ll
know he&rsquo;s Okay.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;Yours,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;Slim.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Bill read this over three times. The
writer, he guessed, must be Harold Johnson,
the fellow he had been taken for on the
island. He recalled distinctly that Sanders
had referred to him as &ldquo;Slim.&rdquo; Who or what
the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; were he had hired, was beyond
Bill. On the other hand it was obvious that
Slim feared Mr. Evans. The scheme, as he
saw it, was that Johnson and his men intended
coming by boat to Maine, where Sanders had
been successful in locating something they
wanted. And, having arrived in Maine
waters, the boat would put her crew of gangsters
ashore at night and stand off the coast
day times. That robbery of some sort was
their objective, Bill had not the slightest
doubt.</p>
<p>But what they intended to steal or where it
was located, Slim had not said. Perhaps it
was something concealed at Turner&rsquo;s&mdash;hidden
in a safe, possibly&mdash;and the &ldquo;experts&rdquo;
had been hired to get it. Still, if Mr. Evans
was hiding something in a safe at Turner&rsquo;s,
what prevented him from moving it to the
strong room of some metropolitan bank,
where it would be beyond reach of both
Sanders and Johnson? Bill discarded the
idea of the safe then and there. The best
he could do was to get in touch with Mr.
Evans or his men just as soon as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>He slipped the letter back into the overcoat
pocket, and folding the coat, replaced
it in the locker. He did not want Sanders
to guess that he had read that letter. Then
he thought over a plan of procedure. If he
took the motor boat to Pig Island, he must
take the coat with him, and Sanders&rsquo; suspicions
would be aroused. If, on the other
hand, he beached the craft and made for
Turner&rsquo;s, Sanders, who was very likely now
footing it for the cove, might think that in
his hurry Bill had overlooked Slim&rsquo;s letter.
Also, he would be more likely to find Mr.
Evans at Turner&rsquo;s, and then, there was
Charlie to be considered. If the boy had
reached the house and his father had not
turned up, he would be forced to stay in that
gloomy place himself overnight, a prospect
that not even Bill relished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>As he reached these conclusions, Bill sent
the motorboat skimming into the cove and
beached her. Then, slipping into his socks
and shoes, he picked up the remainder of his
clothes. It took him but a moment to cross
the sand and climb the rocks. Soon he was
jogging along the lane at a smart trot. He
neither met nor saw a single soul. At last he
gained the back door by way of the overgrown
shrubbery. He found the key under the mat
where they had left it after breakfast. Bill
inserted it in the lock and walked into the
back entry.</p>
<p>Instead of calling Charlie, he walked into
the big kitchen and looked about. Everything
seemed exactly as they had left it after
washing up that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a cinch the kid never got back
here,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d have spent
most of the day in here, consuming provisions,
and there&rsquo;s not a thing been touched. I&rsquo;d
better make sure, though&mdash;and if I can scare
up a gun of sorts, all to the good!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>His inspection of the entire house, including
the cellar, proved his surmise to be
well founded. He was alone in the place.
Charlie, he figured, had either trudged into
Clayton to get in touch with Ezra Parker,
or he had been captured by Sanders and his
men.</p>
<p>And then it occurred to Bill that it would
be well for him to see Parker himself, tonight,
so he went down the tunnel to the
garage and switched on the lights.</p>
<p>It was dark by the time he got back to the
library. He went the rounds of the ground
floor again, turning on electrics as he went.
If Bill was to be caught by anybody around
the spooky house, it would not be unawares,
if he could help it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>He got himself some supper and ate it in
the kitchen. But somehow, after going to
the trouble of preparing food, he had little
appetite. The possibility that the house
might have another hidden entrance of which
he knew nothing made him feel nervous and
jumpy, especially since he had not found
anything remotely resembling a firearm of
any sort.</p>
<p>After he had washed his plate and cup at
the kitchen sink, he went back to the library,
and pulling down a book at random from the
shelves, went out of the room to the hall.</p>
<p>He had decided to wait until eleven, and
then make tracks through the woods to Twin
Heads Harbor. Ezra Parker was due to fly
over the house at midnight and the lighted
garage would be sure to send him to the
harbor directly afterward.</p>
<p>Bill planned to spend the intervening time
in the comfortable alcove which formed a
little lounge below the staircase in the hall.
Here he could at once be aware of the slightest
movement from any part of the house.
And with the curtains drawn, he was shut off
like a monk in his cell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>But instead of settling down to his book,
he grew restless. Twice he got up and examined
the shutters on that floor to make sure
they were barred. Each time he went back
to his curtained retreat, ashamed of himself.
This house was giving him the creeps. For
some reason, he could not tell why, his nerves
were on edge.</p>
<p>As ten o&rsquo;clock chimed faintly from the
mantel timepiece, he thought he heard footsteps.
He started up, reviling himself for
his folly. The house was old, and it was only
the stairs above him that creaked softly.
With calm deliberation he brushed past the
curtain into the hall, determined to pull himself
together.</p>
<p>Standing at the foot of the staircase, a hand
on the great oak balustrade, he could hear the
quiet patter of a mouse behind the panelling.
The tick of the little clock in the alcove, and
the hiss and sigh of the wind without, were
all that broke the silence of the night. No
human being save himself seemed to be
stirring for miles around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Slowly, in stocking feet, he walked down
the kitchen passage, paused, and slowly returned.
Then he mounted the stairs. All
was quiet above. An impulse took him up
the narrow stairway to the third story, where
he looked out a window at the end of the
corridor. The night was dark and only a
grayish glimmer marked the sea. The island
was invisible. Up there, with the still house
below him, he felt like an onlooker in some
mysterious play where life and death were
casual matters and any means were fair if
they led to triumph.</p>
<p>But there was nothing to be gained by pursuing
such thoughts&mdash;and far from being an
onlooker, Bill was very much in the thick of
it all. He descended, made another tour of
the ground floor, and returned to the alcove.
Feeling distinctly more cheerful, he ate a
couple of cookies, took up his book and began
to read. Perhaps five minutes later, he heard
a gentle tap&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>It was not imagination this time. Of that
he was quite certain. Bill was perfectly
calm. He had got over his bout of restlessness
that had kept him on the jump. The
only disturbing point about the sound was
whether it came from within or without the
house.</p>
<p>A leaf blowing against a window, that
might have caused it. The creak of an old
beam would have made the same sound. He
waited in silence, and kept a tight grip on
himself. No more strung-up nerves, whether
this was a false alarm or not. Perhaps a
minute later, he heard the click again.</p>
<p>With an exclamation of annoyance, Bill
got to his feet, brushed aside the curtain, and
peered into the hall.</p>
<p>He found himself face to face with Mr.
Zenas Sanders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="sc">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="small">THE OFFER AND THE THREAT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Bolton,&rdquo; said the intruder
mockingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; Bill replied politely. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;s of any use to inquire how you
got in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s manner rather flabbergasted
Bill. If there had been any suspicion of
menace in Sanders&rsquo; attitude, Bill would have
gone for him straightway with his fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest, Mr. Bolton!&rdquo; And
then with a nod and a smile, &ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Bill was still holding the curtain aside,
Sanders stepped past him into the lounge. On
the table beside the lamp and book he laid a
little automatic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;No need for that, I hope,&rdquo; he remarked
pleasantly, and dropped into an armchair
quite within reach of the revolver. He gave
Bill that curious, quick, confidential nod, then
took out a gold case and lighted a cigarette.
He blew a thin spiral of smoke into the air
with obvious enjoyment. For cool nerve, the
man&rsquo;s manner took Bill&rsquo;s breath away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without going into details,&rdquo; he said offhandedly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve as much right here as you,
so you&rsquo;ll pardon me if I make myself at home,
won&rsquo;t you? Sit down&mdash;sit down, Bolton.&rdquo;
He pointed to a small seat at the side of the
hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I said, sit down!&rdquo; Mr. Sanders&rsquo;
voice was not raised in the least, but his words
came at Bill like an order. A trifle dazed,
he sank into the chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>There was no reason why he shouldn&rsquo;t
have hurled the lamp in Sanders&rsquo; face, and in
the darkness, pitched the table on top of him.
But instead, for no reason he could give, Bill
obeyed him, and sat waiting for him to speak.
Naturally curious to fathom the reason for
this visit, Bill was astounded by his attitude,
considering what had happened in the motorboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d find you here, Bolton, so I&rsquo;ve
dropped in for a chat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill leaned back, looking at him, but said
nothing.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders raised his eyebrows, but the
tone of his voice did not alter. &ldquo;I take it
that you&rsquo;re a straightforward sort of fellow,
Bolton. You know where you stand with
them. I bear no malice for this afternoon&rsquo;s
performance&mdash;in fact I admire you. At the
present moment, you&rsquo;re hating me like poison,
and the only justification you have is that I
didn&rsquo;t knock before I entered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so remarkably polite tonight,&rdquo;
murmured Bill, &ldquo;you might have carried
your politeness a little further.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Again Sanders gave his quick nod and
smiled. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t always wise to knock,
Bolton. For instance, you might have mistaken
my politeness. Since it&rsquo;s an informal
hour to call, you might not have invited me
in&mdash;and I hate talking on doorsteps. I want
a serious talk with you, Bolton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill made no comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Bolton,&rdquo; he went on, knocking
the ash from his cigarette, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re on a fool&rsquo;s
errand. Quite bluntly, you&rsquo;re taking part in
a losing game. I&rsquo;m being plain with you.
Your side hasn&rsquo;t the foggiest hope of success&mdash;for,
frankly, I hold all the cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;and so what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; He punctuated his words
with a long forefinger. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you brains
enough to see you&rsquo;re being made a catspaw.
You&rsquo;re the one that&rsquo;s to do the dirty work&mdash;you
are the lad that&rsquo;s to run the risks and take
all the hard knocks. How do you like the
job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kicking,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Sanders smiled again. &ldquo;Well, how much
are you getting out of it? That&rsquo;s the
point.... Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s not my business. I
know your type&mdash;stupid&mdash;loyal. I admire
stupidity and loyalty because they are
generally exerted in a good cause. But when
they are wasted qualities&mdash;wasted on one of
the worst scoundrels in America, it pains me.
I&rsquo;m a student of these things, Bolton&mdash;it&rsquo;s
part of a lawyer&rsquo;s job to weigh motives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lawyer&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Bill looked surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he returned affably. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an
honorable enough profession, eh? I started
to read for the English bar and chucked it.
I&rsquo;m a Londoner by birth, you see. But I had
a knack for the law. In America I&rsquo;ve
practised ten years as an attorney. However,
my energies at present are devoted to tracking
down a scoundrel named Evans. Do you
follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Mr. Sanders nodded again. &ldquo;Thank you.
I&rsquo;ll come to the point at once, but I wanted
you to understand the situation. I intend to
get this Mr. Evans, and get him I shall.
Soon&mdash;very soon. Much sooner than he expects.
There is no way out of it for him. I
will get him in the end, and the end is not far
off.&rdquo; The pleasant look had gone from his
eyes, and his mouth was hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want him?&rdquo; Bill blurted
out, and a moment later would have done
anything to withdraw his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Sanders cried, &ldquo;I thought so! He
has been clever enough to conceal that.
Exactly. So that is part of his game! Well,
my young friend, it&rsquo;s part of mine, too. It
is nobody&rsquo;s business at present but Mr. Evans&rsquo;
and my own. And I tell you, there is no
sacrifice I wouldn&rsquo;t make to meet that man
face to face, alone, for ten minutes. Look
here, Bolton, to come to brass tacks, how
much do you want in hard cash to tell me
where Evans is at this moment?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Sanders leaned forward, his glowering
eyes fixed upon Bill&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Bill stared back at him and an angry devil
rose within the lad. Bribery&mdash;so that was
the object of his visit! And the man certainly
played his cards well. He insinuated that
Mr. Evans was a scoundrel, that Bill himself
was being made a tool. That was bad enough,
and the astuteness of his argument was apparent,
but the bribery business stung young
Bolton&rsquo;s pride. He sprang to his feet, determined
to lash out at the white, grinning
face.</p>
<p>Sanders held up his hand, reading his purpose.
&ldquo;Bolton, I&rsquo;m delighted. I can see
you&rsquo;re a good fellow. You refuse to give
away your man. If you had fallen for that,
I wouldn&rsquo;t have had much respect for you,
would I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the blazes are you getting at now?&rdquo;
demanded Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do sit down, my dear chap.&rdquo; Again
came that quick nod. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no respect for a
fellow who sells his boss&mdash;cheaply. I&rsquo;m not
asking you to do that, Bolton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this. Why not come over to my side?
Why not leave a sinking ship and come aboard
a sound one? Whatever you&rsquo;re getting out of
this game in hard cash, I&rsquo;ll double. Row in
with me, Bolton. You won&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing.&rdquo; Bill spoke slowly and
emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t&mdash;change your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was going to do better than that.
In fact, my suggestion is that you come in
partnership with me. I know that your
father is a wealthy man&mdash;very wealthy&mdash;but
millions of dollars are not to be despised by
anyone. There are very big things at stake,
Bolton, very big indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>He leaned forward, his eyes fixed on Bill&rsquo;s,
the smoke from his cigarette curling up between
them like a banner. &ldquo;Well? Don&rsquo;t
misunderstand me, Bolton. I don&rsquo;t mean that
you&rsquo;re to leave Mr. Evans. Oh, not at all.
No need for you to have a row with him or
anything of the sort. No, no, you can go on
exactly as you are doing. Carry out whatever
he has sent you here to do. Only there
will be a little understanding between us two,
Bolton, and no one except ourselves will know
anything about it. To prove I am in earnest,
I will give you money now if you want it.
Won&rsquo;t you shake on it, young man?&rdquo; He
held out his hand with as friendly a smile as
Bill had ever seen. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just this&mdash;&rdquo; Bill said evenly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not posing as a saint, but I tell you to your
face I think you&rsquo;re one of the lowest sorts of
cads I&rsquo;ve ever met. You&rsquo;re not clever enough
to get Mr. Evans yourself, so you come sneaking
along and try to bribe one of his friends.
But you&rsquo;ve struck the wrong guy. You can
keep your filthy money. You can offer a
share of your rotten business, whatever it is,
to anybody who is rotten enough to go in with
you. Is that plain English, or do you want
me to make it plainer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if Bill had touched a button, Sanders&rsquo;
face changed. Gone was his cordial air, his
friendly smile. In its place, an evil look of
anger and wounded pride. He had failed in
his mission and he knew he had failed; but
Bill could see that he wasn&rsquo;t the man to take
failure lying down. With an impatient gesture,
Mr. Sanders flung his cigarette into the
fireplace and got to his feet. White spots
showed on his nostrils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolton,&rdquo; he said in low, suppressed tones,
&ldquo;neither men nor boys trifle with me&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
learn that before you&rsquo;re much older. I&rsquo;ve
given you your chance and you&rsquo;ve refused
to take it. Now I shall give you my
orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orders?&rdquo; Bill laughed at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you till tomorrow night to
obey my orders or the consequences for young
Charlie Evans and some other people will be
sudden and&mdash;er&mdash;not pleasant. By nine
o&rsquo;clock tomorrow evening as a deadline you
will be in Gring&rsquo;s Hotel, in Stamford, Connecticut.
You will ask for Mr. Harold
Johnson, and you will tell him exactly where
Mr. Evans is to be found. When you meet
Johnson, you will nod, as I have a habit of
doing, and you will say &lsquo;Zenas,&rsquo; which happens
to be my first name. You will also pass
Johnson your word of honor that you will quit
this game for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stamford is a long way from here,&rdquo;
temporized Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you have an excellent plane at
Parker&rsquo;s, in Clayton.&rdquo; Sanders laughed
shortly. &ldquo;This is not a lone hand I&rsquo;m playing,
Bolton. I have an organization behind
me, and it is a thoroughly efficient one. What
I don&rsquo;t know about you, and particularly your
doings since that youngster Charlie brought
you his father&rsquo;s message, would not be worth
writing home about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I refuse?&rdquo; Bill crossed his legs
and looked at him with as much insolence as
he could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you refuse, Mister Midshipman Bolton,
your friend Charlie, who my men caught
up this morning, and the girl, Deborah, will
have to take the consequences of your bullheadedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly Bill got to his feet. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your
filthy threat, is it?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You hold
that over my head. Well, Mr. Zenas Sanders,
two can play at your game!&rdquo; Bill took a step
forward, prepared to spring on him.</p>
<p>The man did not move. A smile had come
back to his face, and again he gave a quick
little nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Bolton! Don&rsquo;t do anything
foolish!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Bill followed the direction of his eyes. In
the corner of the alcove, appearing between
the folds of the curtain, was the long, blue-black
barrel of a rifle, and it was pointed at
Bill&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; sneered Sanders. &ldquo;It would
have paid you to become my friend. You
haven&rsquo;t the option now. Nine o&rsquo;clock tomorrow
night by the latest, at Gring&rsquo;s Hotel,
Bolton&mdash;or&mdash;you know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanders slipped behind the curtain out of
sight. At the same moment the barrel of the
gun disappeared. With a cry, Bill snatched
up the automatic from the table where
Sanders had overlooked it, and darted into
the hall.</p>
<p>But the hall was empty. No sound came
from any part of the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="sc">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="small">ANOTHER INTRUDER</span></h2>
<p>For several minutes Bill stood still and
listened. Not even a board creaked. The
house was as quiet as a tomb. Of one thing
he felt certain: Mr. Zenas Sanders and his
bodyguard had left the place for good.
There would be no more visitors tonight.</p>
<p>He looked at his wristwatch. It was
quarter to eleven. Fifteen minutes more,
and he would slip out of the back door and
make his way over to Twin Heads Harbor.
More than ever now, he wanted to get in
touch with Ezra Parker. Two heads would
be much better than one in this predicament.
He must have advice. Too much hung on
the decision he must make&mdash;he dared not
rely on his own judgment alone. But there
must be some way out of this mysterious business.
Parker, that clear-headed Yankee,
would be able to suggest the proper course to
follow, if anybody could. The last thing to
do before leaving, was to make sure that the
garage was still lighted up. Parker must not
fail their rendezvous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>And now Bill realized that it was no longer
necessary to leave lights burning all over the
house. Pocketing the small automatic which
Mr. Sanders had so thoughtlessly provided, he
picked up his flashlight, and set about switching
off electrics in the various rooms.</p>
<p>Working his way through the house, he
came to the butler&rsquo;s pantry. Even in full
sunshine it must have been depressing. With
only the narrow beam of his flash to illumine
it, the place was dank enough to plunge the
most cheerful person into a mood of melancholy.
Bill gazed at the wall with its jail-like
row of keys, each bearing a small tag
with the name of a room in diminutive handwriting.
Above the keys was an ordinary
glass frame which enclosed the indicators of
bells from the rooms. It seemed as if he
were watching the still heart of the house,
with wires leading like bloodless arteries to
the gaunt and distant chambers. Suddenly,
Bill flashed his torch full upon the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>He had thought he saw one of the indicators
move. The bell had not rung&mdash;or he had
not heard it&mdash;but he could have sworn that
he had seen one of the disks tremble. He
peered closer. For a full minute he watched
the indicators, but now could discern no
movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nerves!&rdquo; he muttered angrily. &ldquo;This
darned house is making a woman of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A glance at his watch showed that it lacked
but five minutes to the hour. He strolled to
the end of the kitchen passage, returned, and
went into the hall to get his cap. The wind
had risen. He could hear it swishing through
the trees outside, a long, low whine in the
pine-needles, in vivid contrast to the deadly
stillness inside the house. He was returning
to the pantry on his way to the back door,
when he felt his heart jump&mdash;and then stand
still. Clear and unmistakable, the tinkling
of an electric bell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Bill leapt into the butler&rsquo;s pantry and his
eyes scanned the double row of indicators on
the wall. Not one of them moved by the
fraction of an inch. A soft, faint whir
sounded again. In some room of the house
a finger was pressed upon an electric button.
Bill went into the passage and listened. The
sound was much clearer now. It seemed to
come from behind the closed door across the
corridor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>That door was of heavy oak, and the key
was in the lock. Even without the white tag
that hung from it, Bill knew it was a second
entrance to the cellar, or so Charlie had
told him. What if the door led to a part of
the cellar that he had not already inspected?
A moment&rsquo;s thought made it plain that Mr.
Evans must have left the key in the door to
prevent the insertion of a duplicate from the
cellar side.</p>
<p>The ringing stopped abruptly. Why on
earth, Bill wondered, should there be an electric
bell in the cellar? Charlie had mentioned
no such thing, and who could have
been ringing it, and why? For a few moments
Bill could not decide whether to investigate
or simply to ignore the matter. There was,
however, the possibility that it was meant to
be a message or a warning to him, and he decided
to find out its meaning at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Extinguishing his flashlight, he gently
turned the key in the cellar door. He pulled
the door open and quickly stepped behind it.
Nothing could be heard from the cellar, not
a rustle, not a whisper. After waiting a
moment or two, Bill ventured to move into
the open doorway. A musty smell floated
up the stairs&mdash;a smell of earth and stagnant
air. With his outstretched foot, Bill explored
until he found the first step. Very
gingerly he descended into the darkness, his
hand touching the stone wall at his side for
guidance. When he reached the bottom, he
paused again to listen. But he could hear
nothing save his own breathing. Then, like
a sudden stab through his brain, the bell
pealed again.</p>
<p>This time it was quite close to him. He felt
that if he reached out he could have touched
it. The flashlight was still clenched in his
hand. He hesitated, then pressed the button
and held the light above his head. The
cellar, vast and irregular, stanchioned by
square stone pillars, lay before him, streaked
by the wavering shadows cast by his light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Bill saw at once that it was not the place
he had gone over with Charlie. Arched
wine-bins, mostly empty, made dim hollows
along the walls. But still he could not locate
the sound. With a final whir the ringing
stopped, and the conviction swept into his
mind that he had been listening, not to a call-bell,
but to a telephone.</p>
<p>Yet he could see nothing that remotely resembled
a telephone instrument. A bare
heavy table with a couple of benches beside
it stood in the middle of the floor, and he
could see nothing else in the dimness save the
blank, arched walls.</p>
<p>Ready to snap off his light at the first hint
of any lurking enemy, Bill pushed forward
and explored two short bays that ran out at
right angles to the main wine cellar, but without
result. Why, he deliberated, should there
be a telephone in this underground spot? So
far as his observation had gone, there was no
phone upstairs, and a cellar seemed a mighty
queer place to instal one. To conceal the instrument
seemed stranger still. Bill noticed
that a passage led off to the left. Avoiding
some tumbled packing-cases on the floor, he
went forward to see what he could find.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>After he had gone about ten yards, he was
brought up short by a heavy door. Like the
one upstairs, this door also had its key in the
lock. It was a primitive sort of lock and
made a loud click as he turned it&mdash;too loud
for Bill&rsquo;s taste in the circumstances. He let
a couple of seconds go by before venturing to
proceed. His hand was on the key, ready
to pull the door open, when something happened
that made him stop and listen intently.
He snapped off his light. From behind the
iron-studded door he imagined&mdash;but was by
no means certain&mdash;that he had heard a sound.</p>
<p>After a minute or two of silence he concluded
that it must have been the wind stirring
in a loose grating in the passage beyond.
But presently he thanked his stars he had
switched off the light, for suddenly he heard
quite clearly the sound of footsteps, approaching
on the other side of the unlocked
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>The situation called for swift action. In
the blinding darkness, he quickly estimated
whether he could possibly get through the
cellar and up into the house in time to avoid
discovery. It was not likely. But there was
a shallow niche in the wall behind the door,
and he slipped into it, praying that he would
remain concealed when the door opened.</p>
<p>The footsteps grew louder, then drew to
a stop. A pause, and then he heard the
mumble of a voice from behind the door.
Somebody was talking over the telephone in
there&mdash;of that Bill felt sure. But the voice
was too low for him to distinguish the words.
Curiosity impelled Bill to risk pulling the
door open half an inch, and he peered
through the crack into the space beyond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Instantly the voice ceased. The place was
pitch dark, and though Bill stared till his
eye-balls ached, he could see nothing. Then
in the inky blackness he heard a slight rustle.
What was the man doing? Even though Bill
had used the utmost care in opening the door,
this stranger must have heard him. Glued
to the crack, he closed his eyes and listened.</p>
<p>At first he heard nothing&mdash;then it came
again&mdash;a faint rustle. It was nearer now&mdash;almost
at the door. Somebody or something
was moving stealthily toward him.</p>
<p>Bill drew back and none too soon. Bang!
A heavy body crashed against the farther
side of the door. It slammed open and back
against the cellar wall with a crash loud
enough to wake the dead. Bill had just time
to realize that had he remained at the crack
he would have had a nasty blow, when sinewy
arms gripped him and he found himself
fighting for his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="sc">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="small">FROM BAD TO WORSE</span></h2>
<p>With unerring skill, the more amazing
because of the inky darkness, Bill&rsquo;s opponent
grasped his right wrist, twisted it and the
automatic dropped to the floor. The flashlight
Bill had discarded at the man&rsquo;s first
spring. In vain he sought to slip his free
hand beneath the other&rsquo;s armpit to try for
a half-Nelson or some other effective hold.
The man was as sinewy and lithe as a snake,
and blocked Bill&rsquo;s every move. He tried <i>jiu
jitsu</i>, but here again he was foiled; and only
with the greatest difficulty was he able to keep
those tenacious hands from his throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Panting and straining, the two swayed back
and forth, crashing into packing cases, banging
into walls, their hot breath on each other&rsquo;s
faces&mdash;twisting, slipping, recovering&mdash;and
drenched in perspiration from their terrific
exertions.</p>
<p>Then, in one of his lunges, Bill stepped on
the electric torch&mdash;and instantly a dim
glow spread along the floor and threw their
figures and faces into relief against the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill Bolton!&rdquo; gasped the stranger, and
released him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Osceola!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too winded for further speech the friends
stared at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great snakes!&rdquo; exclaimed the young
Seminole chief at last. &ldquo;A jolly way you
have of receiving callers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why on earth didn&rsquo;t you come to
the front door and ring the bell like a Christian?&rdquo;
growled Bill. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?
Snooping in through the wine cellar and scaring
me half to death? This confounded
house is creepy enough without you adding
to the spooks!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;The front door,&rdquo; retorted Osceola, &ldquo;was
out of the question. How did I know you
were in the place? Sanders has his men
posted all around here. He came out of the
back door with another guy less than half
an hour ago, and I saw them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill picked up the torch and the automatic
before replying. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to know
how they got in?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I locked the
back entry from the inside, so they couldn&rsquo;t
have come that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola shook his head. &ldquo;No. They got
in the same way I did. Their footprints are
all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But which way is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old shed in the woods about
fifty yards from the house. Mr. Evans told
me about it. Once upon a time it was used
for storing firewood, and it connects with the
cellar by a kind of tunnel. They broke in
there, picked the cellar lock, and went on
up into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they couldn&rsquo;t have come through this
cellar&mdash;I found both doors locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have to come through here.
There&rsquo;s a circular stair that leads from where
the phone is, up through that wall and out
into the hall above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill nodded, remembering the speed with
which Sanders and his man had disappeared.
&ldquo;Just where and how does it connect with the
hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sliding panel in the wall by the
fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! You and Sanders,&rdquo; said Bill,
&ldquo;seem to know a lot more about this place
than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Evans put me hep. How Sanders
got his information, I don&rsquo;t know, but he&rsquo;s
evidently got it all down pat. That old brick
shed out there takes some finding. It&rsquo;s all
overgrown with vines and bushes&mdash;I had a
job finding it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me, Osceola&mdash;&rdquo; Bill perched on
the edge of the table, &ldquo;how did you happen
to be telephoning in here&mdash;how did you get
here? I must get straightened out on this
business before I hike over to see Parker at
Twin Heads Harbor tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parker flew me up to Clayton from New
Canaan,&rdquo; the chief told him. &ldquo;Then he
drove me over here in his car&mdash;or that is, I
left him where the road to Turner&rsquo;s leaves
the Harbor Highway, and came the rest of
the way on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please start at the beginning, won&rsquo;t you?
I&rsquo;m still all at sea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, all right&mdash;don&rsquo;t get all het up
now! Well, Deborah Lightfoot, the girl
I&rsquo;m engaged to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What!</i> Not the girl on the island&mdash;Evans&rsquo;
secretary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you never told me you were engaged!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I? Well, we&rsquo;re going to get married
next year, just as soon as I&rsquo;m graduated
from Carlisle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;I certainly
congratulate you both. But say, let&rsquo;s get on
with the business end of this gab. Begin
with Mr. Evans&mdash;when you saw him or heard
from him first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; grinned Osceola.
&ldquo;I came out from New York on an early train
to New Canaan yesterday afternoon, after
seeing your father off for Washington. The
servants were in a great state about the night
before. It seems that the shooting woke them
up after you and Charlie got out of the house.
I read your note and reckoned that since
neither you nor Charles nor the plane were
on the premises, you&rsquo;d managed to get off
all right. You had told me in your note to
stay put till I heard from you, so I stuck
round the house all evening, waiting for a
wire, or a phone call. I was especially
worried about Deborah. She graduated from
Barnard in June, and shortly after this Flying
Fish affair was cleaned up, I got her the job
with Mr. Evans. I knew she was up here in
Maine with him, but from what you wrote,
it looked as if old Evans had got himself
mixed up in a thug war or something, and I
didn&rsquo;t want my girl to be stopping bullets.
Mind you, Deb can take care of herself in a
mixup better than most men. She&rsquo;s a swell
shot, and she can throw a tomahawk as true
as any brave in the Seminole Nation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns! I had no idea she was a
Seminole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sure is,&rdquo; grinned his friend. &ldquo;Deb
is Sachem of the Water Moccasin Clan in her
own right. She&rsquo;s a sort of &rsquo;steenth cousin of
mine&mdash;and <i>brains</i>&mdash;well, she&rsquo;s two years
younger than I am and yet she&rsquo;s a year ahead
of me in college. She&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; laughed Bill. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it for
granted and all that, that she&rsquo;s the most wonderful
girl in the world.... Get back to your
story, now. You were worried because she
was up here, you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, I was. But I decided to hang
round your place for the night and wait for
your message&mdash;which never came. If I
didn&rsquo;t hear by morning, my plan was to come
along up here by train, whether you needed
me or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then Mr. Evans turned up, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did. The sound of the plane sent me
running out to the hangar in the middle of
breakfast. At first when I saw the <i>Loening</i>,
I thought you had come back. Then old
Evans piled out and introduced Parker, who
had flown him down. I took them into the
house and we had breakfast together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s got a nerve! Disappearing on
us in the first place, and then taking my plane
to do it in!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he said he hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to let
you know, or to ask your permission to use the
<i>Loening</i>. Matters suddenly came to a head
and he had to get to Stamford as soon as possible.
It seems that some of Sanders&rsquo; crowd
hang out there and they were up to something
he couldn&rsquo;t get the hang of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;they&rsquo;re coming up here in
a boat of some kind. They&rsquo;re after something
that belongs to Mr. Evans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said. I mean, he described
Sanders and told me that his crowd was trying
to steal something from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t Evans move it to some safe
deposit and let us out of all this hullabaloo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the funny part of it is, that he
doesn&rsquo;t know where it is&mdash;and apparently
Sanders and his lads do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>is</i> a funny one,&rdquo; grunted Bill.
&ldquo;Evans, the owner, doesn&rsquo;t know where this
valuable something is&mdash;and the would-be
robbers do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he told me, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>what</i> is it that they&rsquo;re raising such
a rumpus about? Does Evans himself know?&rdquo;
Bill was getting sarcastic over the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me. He didn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;s the limit. Here I get
all het up, thinking that at last I&rsquo;m going
to find out something definite about this
mess&mdash;and you tell me you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evans thinks, I guess, that it&rsquo;s less dangerous
for us not to know. He&rsquo;s a pretty
good egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill frowned, then began to chuckle.
&ldquo;Sanders offered me a couple of million or
so, if I&rsquo;d go in with him. Can you beat that?
So whatever the blooming loot is, it&rsquo;s worth
money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it. But let me finish. I was
just starting to talk to Deb over the private
line in the other room, when you came butting
in and I had to ring off. You may not
know it, but I&rsquo;m rather anxious to finish that
conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go to the phone now, if you must,&rdquo;
said Bill resignedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll get this off my chest first. You&rsquo;re
in almost as much of a sweat as old Evans was
at breakfast this morning. He wouldn&rsquo;t talk
while the waitress was in the room, so things
were a bit jerky. But when we&rsquo;d finished
eating, and one of your cars was waiting to run
him down to Stamford, he told me about
Sanders. Then he described this place, told
me how to get into it through the sub-cellar,
and where the short-line phone to the island
was hidden. He suggested that Parker take
some sleep, and then fly me up here so I could
keep an eye on Deborah. To finish the story,
Parker and I took turns flying the bus, and
here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Evans say what I was supposed
to be doing?&rdquo; inquired Bill. &ldquo;He left while
Charlie and I were asleep. I&rsquo;ve had no instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he wants you to keep careful watch
on the Sanders crowd, so you can locate what
they&rsquo;re trying to steal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! A nice, soft job that! How am I
going to find something when I don&rsquo;t know
what it is? The man&rsquo;s got bats in his belfry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but that&rsquo;s what he
said. By the way, where&rsquo;s Charlie&mdash;upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not&mdash;and that&rsquo;s another thing that
gets my goat. While his father flies on without
a word&mdash;Sanders gets the boy!&rdquo; Bill
went on to tell Osceola of the day&rsquo;s happenings.
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m between
two fires. It&rsquo;s the dickens of a mess.
If I go to Stamford, and pretend to play in
with that gang, I can&rsquo;t be watching them up
here&mdash;and if I don&rsquo;t go there&rsquo;s no telling
what Sanders may do with that kid. My plan
before you came along was to meet Ezra
Parker at the Harbor, and see what his advice
would be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; said Osceola thoughtfully.
He had been squatting on his heels, Indian
fashion, and now stood up. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;There goes that telephone again. I
guess Deb got tired of waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she know you were here? It
was that bell jingling that brought me down
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called her up when I got in the cellar.
Jim answered and said she was out on the
rocks&mdash;so she called me back.&rdquo; He hurried
off to the other end of the cellar with Bill
close behind him holding the light.</p>
<p>Osceola fumbled with a brick in the wall,
it came away in his hands and he pushed his
arm into the cavity. A panel in the wall
swung outward, revealing the fact that it was
not brick at all, but cleverly painted wood.
The ringing of the bell immediately became
louder, for in the open niche stood a telephone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>The chief picked up the receiver. &ldquo;Hello,
hello&mdash;&rdquo; Bill heard him say. &ldquo;Yes, this is
Osceola. Yes, Deb, I&rsquo;m all right. Bill is
here. We mistook each other for Sanders&rsquo;
men in the dark&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I rang off. But
everything is okay now. No, I don&rsquo;t mean
exactly that ... Sanders has kidnapped Charlie
and.... What are you saying? Great guns&mdash;is
that so? Yes, I can hear firing. Hang on
as long as you can&mdash;don&rsquo;t give up&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be
with you just as soon as possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up, slammed shut the camouflaged
panel and turned to Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil to pay! Deb and old Jim are
barricaded in the hut on Pig Island. Sanders&rsquo;
men have got the place surrounded!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="sc">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="small">ON THE WAY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a pretty pair of fools!&rdquo; cried Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you.&rdquo; Osceola, usually
stoical under trying conditions, was visibly
upset. &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re scrapping and swapping
stories, that girl of mine is being kidnapped
by those ruffians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they haven&rsquo;t got into the house yet,&rdquo;
Bill reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can those two do against so
many! After what Sanders said to you, we
should have been prepared for this. For the
love of Mike, Bill, hold that light steady!
I can&rsquo;t find the brick that manipulates the
panel to the woodshed tunnel.&mdash;There&mdash;that&rsquo;s
better!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>A section of the cellar wall opened and the
light from the torch shone on a flight of stone
steps leading into the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a jiffy, till I pick up my rifle&mdash;&rdquo;
The young Seminole disappeared, then returned
with the gun in his hands. &ldquo;Lucky
I decided to tackle you with my fists rather
than shoot in the dark! Got everything you
need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then turn the light on the wall to your
left&mdash;third brick from the bottom&mdash;there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled it out, fumbled in the aperture
for a moment and the cellar door slid shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, it&rsquo;s dark&mdash;&rdquo; Bill went down the
steps and along the tunnel, sending the light
beam before him. &ldquo;How did you manage to
navigate without a flash?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;My race, as you know, see better in the
dark than you pale-faces. But it wasn&rsquo;t easy,
just the same. Some of the roof is down
farther ahead, and I barked my shin on one of
the stone blocks. Rotten air in here too. Mr.
Evans said that Turner was quite a guy at
smuggling in his day. He told me that the
house is a regular warren of secret passages.
What time is it, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just eleven-forty-five. Parker ought to
be over the house in fifteen minutes. That
is, if he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will&mdash;&rdquo; declared the Seminole. &ldquo;He
said he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he wakes up in time, you mean. After
those two long hops, he&rsquo;ll be a dead &rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not so bad. I flew the plane most of
the way up here,&rdquo; confessed Osceola. &ldquo;So
Parker caught plenty of sleep on the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy! Your instructor is proud of
you. Look out&mdash;here are those blocks you
tripped over before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>They scrambled over the debris and a few
moments later came to another flight of stone
steps. Osceola manipulated the sliding door
at the top very much in the same manner as
he had closed the one to the cellar. Bill
switched off his light and they entered a small,
one-roomed building. Here the Indian led
him past a broken doorway and through a
dense thicket of evergreen and brambles.
When they reached the more open woods,
Osceola paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ambled over these woods the day we
corralled our friend the Baron,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;And I took a look at the outside of Turner&rsquo;s
then. Keep the moon on your right and
you&rsquo;re bound to hit the harbor. It&rsquo;s between
two and a half and three miles over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;
asked Bill in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to the cove and out to Pig Island!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve no boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swim out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re crazy, Osceola! I know
you&rsquo;re a marvel in the water, but there isn&rsquo;t
a swimmer living who could breast that current.
Believe me, I tried it, and I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can make a try at it, too, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use? Hike along with me and
we&rsquo;ll be over there with the <i>Loening</i> in half
the time you could swim that distance in easy
water. Anyway, there&rsquo;s your rifle&mdash;you&rsquo;d
have to leave that behind. Don&rsquo;t be a sap, old
fella. You can&rsquo;t fight ten or a dozen of the
Sanders tribe with your fists!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola, who had led his class at Carlisle,
and would captain the football team in the
fall, was a young man whose brain worked
fast. Moreover, he was never afraid to admit
he might be wrong and to profit by another&rsquo;s
advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.
&ldquo;I guess I let myself get carried away
a bit. I&rsquo;ll go with you. Let&rsquo;s be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good egg. I know you&rsquo;re worried half
sick about Deborah, and I don&rsquo;t blame you.
You lead on, old scout. We&rsquo;ll make it, yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osceola started off at a sharp dog trot that
he could keep up for hours if need be. Bill
ran lightly behind him, glad to be in the open
air and away from that uncanny house at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>A ten-mile breeze blowing in from the sea
rustled the treetops and shadows cast by a
full moon danced over the undergrowth.
Clouds were banking to the eastward, the salt
tang of the ocean was in the air. Bill sensed
rain or a storm and was glad that the cloud
formation, creeping upward, would shortly
blot out the silvery light. Should they be
forced to land on Pig Island in moonlight
nearly as bright as day, the odds would be all
with their enemies.</p>
<p>Osceola, with that natural bump of direction
which is inherent in all races of American
Indians, struck an overgrown deer track
and followed it. Bill, running on his second
wind, saw the young Chief slacken his pace
for an instant, then dart ahead at a stiffer gait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes!&rdquo; the Indian called over
his shoulder. &ldquo;If we hustle, we&rsquo;ll reach the
shore soon after he lands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>The white lad could hear nothing but the
soft thud of his own footsteps and the gentle
swish of the night wind in the treetops. Then,
dimly at first, came the almost imperceptible
drone of an engine far away. Within a very
few minutes, the hum grew to a roar and the
dark shape and tail-light of an airplane passed
above their heads, flying low in the same direction
they were traveling.</p>
<p>Osceola slowed down to a brisk walk. The
ground sloped upward and rocky outcroppings
made running impossible. Then he stopped
altogether and waited for his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There we are!&rdquo; He pointed forward and
down.</p>
<p>Bill, who was not sorry for the breather,
saw that they stood on the crest of the rise.
Straight ahead the ground slanted sharply
downward. Through breaks in the foliage,
a wide stretch of moonlit water could be seen.
Floating gently on the rippling cove near the
shore lay the seaplane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder, Osceola! How were
you able to draw a bead on Parker like that?
I was sure we were in for at least a mile&rsquo;s
tramp along the shore before we&rsquo;d get within
hailing distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing mysterious about it. That&rsquo;s a
cove off the main harbor you&rsquo;re looking at.
Parker told me of his rendezvous with you.
I knew about this cove, and made it a bit more
definite, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;ll give him the signal
and we&rsquo;ll go on down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two sharp barks of a fox came from
Osceola&rsquo;s throat. Immediately the idling hum
of the airplane motor increased to a roar,
awakening forest echoes and the amphibian
commenced to move through the water
toward the shore. Without a word the two
friends scrambled down the rocky incline to
meet it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, chief?&rdquo; called Ezra Parker&rsquo;s
voice as they neared the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is. And I&rsquo;ve got Bill Bolton with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; answered the aviator, as
they came onto the narrow beach. &ldquo;How be
yer, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rearin&rsquo; to go, Ezra&mdash;and I reckon that&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;ve got to do, pronto!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty. Sanders has got Charlie, and the
gang&rsquo;s over at Pig Island right now, trying
to capture Deborah and old Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh all hemlock!&rdquo; exploded Ezra.
&ldquo;Things are popping, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s not the half of it,&rdquo; cut in
Osceola. &ldquo;If Bill doesn&rsquo;t hike down to Stamford,
Connecticut, and prove to members of
the Sanders outfit down there that he is out of
this thing for keeps&mdash;those devils threaten to
put Charlie out of the way, and Deborah too,
if they can get her!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that sure is the limit!&rdquo; Ezra&rsquo;s
tone was filled with concern. &ldquo;Jump aboard,
boys, while I run her out in the harbor.
There&rsquo;s no telling who may be sneakin&rsquo;
&rsquo;round in these woods. No sense takin&rsquo; any
more chances than we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief swung himself on to the amphibian&rsquo;s
deck which ran from amidships forward
to her nose below the two cockpits and
inverted motor. Bill meanwhile quickly
doffed his clothes, which together with
Sanders&rsquo; automatic he flung to the Seminole.
He waded into the water, pushed the plane
out until she floated clear, and walked out
until he could grasp a wing tip. After much
heaving and hauling, for the water was up
to his armpits, he managed to swing the plane
around until her nose was pointed toward the
mouth of the cove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Bill,&rdquo; said Ezra, and Osceola
gave his pal a hand aboard. &ldquo;This place is
too narrow for man&oelig;uvering. I was wonderin&rsquo;
how I could get her out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme a towel!&rdquo; Bill&rsquo;s teeth were chattering.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one in the locker in your
cockpit, Ezra. Lucky you didn&rsquo;t try swimming
over to the island tonight, Osceola. If
anything is colder than this Maine ocean
when the sun&rsquo;s off it, I&rsquo;ve yet to find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Osceola he piled into the rear cockpit.
Then while, Parker taxied the plane out
to mid-harbor, Bill got into his clothes.
Parker snapped off the ignition and twisted
around in his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s have the lowdown on this,
Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill climbed down to the deck and gave
him a short outline of the events of the day
and evening. &ldquo;Kind of between the devil
and the deep sea, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; he finished
grimly. &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s more than money now. So
hop in aft with the chief, and let me in the
fore cockpit. I&rsquo;m going to fly the bus. There
ought to be a couple of repeating rifles and
ammunition in the locker aft. Pass one of
them out to me, will you, Osceola? Ezra can
use the other. You two, stick on head-phones.
While I&rsquo;m driving, see if you can&rsquo;t come to
some decision about this Stamford business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>As Parker climbed out of the fore cockpit
and went aft, Bill hopped into the vacated
pilot&rsquo;s seat. A rifle and ammunition were
passed to him. He made sure that the magazine
was full, then pulled forth a helmet and
goggles from a small locker. These he put
on, cast a hurried glance aft and satisfying
himself that his companions were ready for
the take-off, he switched on the ignition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="sc">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="small">PIG ISLAND AGAIN</span></h2>
<p>Bill sent the amphibian roaring into the
night wind, pulled her off the rippling waters
of the harbor and skimming the twin bluffs at
the entrance, sent his bus speeding seaward.
A bank to starboard brought Pig Island dead
ahead and Bill saw that the moon glare, playing
on the islet, threw every detail into bold
relief. On the instant he changed his plan.</p>
<p>Counting on the heavy cloud formation
which was slowly spreading upward from the
east, his first idea had been to land near the
shore, and after securing the plane on one of
the beaches, to rush the besiegers under cover
of darkness. Now that the moonlight doomed
such procedure to certain failure, he proceeded
to climb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>At six hundred feet, he leveled off and sent
the <i>Loening</i> speeding in a circle around the
island. The house, a one-story bungalow, built
of native stone with hollow tile roof, stood on
a craggy knoll near the center of the island.
Bill saw that this slight eminence held unusual
factors of defense. Not only was it
impossible to look down on the house from
any other point on the island, but the rocky
ground sloped steeply on all sides from the
top of the knoll. The one bad feature of the
place was the number of large boulders nature
had splattered up and down the incline. Behind
twelve or fifteen of these big stones and
completely ringing the little fortress above
them, crouched the party of armed men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>As he circled, Bill saw the flashes from the
gangster&rsquo;s rifles and the answering flashes
from the house. He noticed that there was
method in the attack, and one that was likely
to succeed in the capture of the bungalow.
There would come a spurt of firing from one
section of the attacking group on the hill,
which naturally drew the two in the house
to that side in order to repel a possible assault.
Immediately the men on the farther side, out
of range from the house, would dash ahead
to take refuge behind boulders further up the
knoll. Once under new cover, they would
start a fusillade which gave the men on the
opposite side a chance to advance. Three of
the gang kept together and every time they
moved, they picked up a heavy log and carted
it up to the next boulder. It was evident that
once Sanders got his crew well up to the house,
these men, covered by the fire of their companions,
would dash forward and batter in the
door with their ram.</p>
<p>Three bodies lying stark on the hillside
bespoke the courage and straight shooting of
the besieged, but the rush must come soon,
and the ultimate capture of the place was inevitable.
&ldquo;Unless we get busy&mdash;and get busy
pronto!&rdquo; muttered Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>He gave a lightning glance behind him.
Ezra Parker and Osceola were firing from the
rear cockpit, but so far without apparent result.
To hit an object on the ground with a
rifle bullet from a speeding airplane is a difficult
feat, but Bill knew that the odds were
against the gangsters. For it is even more
difficult to hit an airplane in flight, that is, if
she is being driven by an experienced pilot.</p>
<p>Much to the disgust of Osceola, who did
not understand the man&oelig;uver, Bill levelled
off and headed out to sea. A quarter of a
mile from the island, he turned in his seat,
and having attracted Parker&rsquo;s attention,
mouthed the words&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Hold fast!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two who were squeezed in the small
cockpit aft nodded their understanding. For
an instant or two longer Bill waited, then assured
that they were secure, he sent the plane
into a wingover. This man&oelig;uver is essentially
a climbing turn followed by a diving
turn, the two aggregating 180 degrees. The
engine is kept running and control is maintained
throughout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>A wingover is entered from level flight.
At first it is merely a normal turn in which
the nose is gradually raised, and slipping and
skidding are to be avoided as usual. Elevation
of the nose may be commenced simultaneously
with the application of the bank.
If so, the stick must be pulled back very
slowly at first, as otherwise a stall will result
and the wingover will be unsatisfactory. In
flight training, unless the student&rsquo;s judgment
is particularly accurate, it is advisable for
him to delay elevation of the nose until a bank
of 15 to 20 degrees has been reached.</p>
<p>Bill steadily increased the bank until the
amphibian was in a fairly steep reverse control
turn with the nose well above the horizon,
and headed approximately 90 degrees from
his original course. He then gave the plane
down rudder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Inasmuch as a fairly good speed had been
obtained, very little rudder was needed. Had
the plane&rsquo;s speed been close to the stalling
point, he would have used more. At the same
time Bill was careful to use the ailerons firmly
to prevent the bank from increasing.</p>
<p>As the nose dropped below the horizon in
response to the rudder, the plane assumed the
position of a steep reverse control spiral, except
that the engine was running. He kept
it momentarily in this position; then as it approached
a heading of 180 degrees from the
entering course, he recovered as if from a
spiral, at the same time raising the plane&rsquo;s
nose to level.</p>
<p>The entire man&oelig;uver of the wingover was
executed, of course, in a fraction of the time
it takes to describe it. Bill used it solely because
he wished to bring the amphibian back
on a course headed for the house on the island
in the least time possible. He now waved a
hand to his companions to make ready. Then
he picked up the rifle he&rsquo;d been sitting on,
rested its barrel on the cowl of the cockpit
and pushed forward the stick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Over went the nose and down shot the plane
in a breath-catching dive to be leveled off with
a jerk, just beyond the breakers. Then with
all three rifles pouring streams of spitting fire,
Bill sent the airplane hurtling across the knoll
at an altitude of less than ten feet above the
heads of the cowering gangsters.</p>
<p>Up zoomed the amphibian on the farther
side of the hill, gained altitude over the water,
did another wingover and swept back across
the knoll, but this time behind the house.</p>
<p>Again and again Bill repeated these telling
evolutions. First one side, then the other was
raked with fire from the plane. Then he
would zoom the house itself in order to
further confuse the besiegers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>On the plane&rsquo;s eighth trip, Sanders&rsquo; forces
broke. Flesh and blood could no longer stand
this death-dealing hail of lead from a plane
impossible to hit. Dragging their wounded
with them, the routed gangsters dashed pell
mell down to the shore. They piled into two
motorboats beached in a cove and in less than
no time, these two crafts were racing toward
the mainland with everything wide open.</p>
<p>Bill let them go. Defense of the old man
and the girl in the house on the hill was one
thing: the shooting down of cowed men
huddled in a couple of boats quite another.
When he was convinced that the rout was
a permanent fact, he landed the plane on the
water, taxied into the same sandy cove from
which the gunmen had departed, and beached
her.</p>
<p>Deborah was waiting on the sand for them.
Osceola was the first overboard and a moment
later the two were clasped in each other&rsquo;s
arms.</p>
<p>Bill grinned at Ezra. &ldquo;So far,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;as you and I are concerned, well, we might
be a couple of other rocks for all they mind!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; returned the older man
as they went about making the plane secure.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in love. We don&rsquo;t exist for them
just now. Don&rsquo;t be so superior&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be
that way yourself some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; scoffed Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking
about. I was like you before the right girl
came along. I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ve thought
any more about the orders Sanders gave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, not to interfere any more with
his plans and to report to that guy in Stamford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And this little adventure has torn
the first part of that to pieces!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the consequences to Charlie of
course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just that. Sanders will now take it for
granted you&rsquo;ve decided to stick to the ship
in spite of his threats. There&rsquo;s no use crying
over the milk we&rsquo;ve spilt tonight, lad. We
had a job to do, and I&rsquo;m throwin&rsquo; no bouquets
when I tell you it was done noble! Too bad
we couldn&rsquo;t have wiped out the entire crew
while we were about it. By the way, I didn&rsquo;t
spot His Nibs in that gang, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sanders wasn&rsquo;t with his men. Guess
distance lends enchantment with Mr. Sanders
when there&rsquo;s a good chance of stopping lead!
That guy hires men to do his fighting. Take
it from me, he is sound asleep in his little
white bed, wherever that may be&mdash;and I only
wish I knew where!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Ezra with a chuckle, &ldquo;is a
worthy thought&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t get us any
forrider with the matter in hand, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill was silent for a moment. Vaguely
conscious that the rising cloud formation had
at last obscured the moon, and the darkness
after the brilliant moonlight seemed inky
black, he wracked his brain for a means to
outwit their enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Suddenly he laughed. &ldquo;What a pack of
blithering idiots we are!&rdquo; he almost shouted.
&ldquo;Look here, Ezra! Sanders doesn&rsquo;t know I
was in the bus. It&rsquo;s dollars to a penny postage
stamp, he thinks I&rsquo;m asleep in my own bed at
Turner&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. That is, if he doesn&rsquo;t send someone
in there again to-night to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Sanders. That guy has a Jehovah
complex. He knows he&rsquo;s a world beater and
doesn&rsquo;t hide his knowledge under any bushel,
either. Why, he&rsquo;s so sure he put cold, naked
fear into me he&rsquo;d bet on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably right,&rdquo; agreed Ezra.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been over to my dump a couple of times.
He&rsquo;s got one of those Buhl-Verville Airsters,
with a man to chauffeur him &rsquo;round. Nice
little job, too. A three-place biplane&mdash;he
can fold the wings back. When they&rsquo;re
folded, the hangar space required is only 9
feet by 13&frac12; feet by 25!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; commented Bill, &ldquo;is very likely
the reason he picked on it&mdash;handy bus to hide.
But what has a Buhl-Verville CW3 got to do
with the price of spinach?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, except your high-hat friend had
me up to fix one of his shock absorbers.
They&rsquo;re of the Oleo rubber disc type on those
crates. You see, under loading conditions,
these rubber discs are in compression and an
internal perforated plunger piston simultaneously
travels into a loaded oil chamber at the
lower end of the strut&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; interrupted Bill, &ldquo;this absorbs the
impact energy and neutralizes the effect of
the rebound, which is so prevalent with the
ordinary rubber spring shock absorbers. It
cushions the landing shocks to the extent of
saving the whole airplane structure from
strains which are occasioned by shocks in bad
landings over rough ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win,&rdquo; laughed Parker. &ldquo;Up here in
this out-of-the-way neck of the woods one
forgets that there are other idiots crazy
enough to waste time messing &rsquo;round with airbusses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks! But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. I got off the track, as usual.
Just wanted to say that I got so gol-darned
mad at that uppish little groundhog, Sanders,
the last time he came &rsquo;round bellyachin&rsquo;
&rsquo;bout the job I done on his shock absorbers&mdash;and
all because his chauffeur got his training
from a correspondence course&mdash;I told him to
get out and stay out. No, he wasn&rsquo;t on deck
tonight&mdash;I&rsquo;d know him a mile away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you said that before. So we&rsquo;ll take
it for granted that if I hop down to Stamford
tomorrow and give that bozo Johnson an earful,
he won&rsquo;t start in making it nasty for
Charlie in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Ezra, &ldquo;we can be reasonably
sure that he won&rsquo;t. And now you and I
had better get up the hill and help Jim with
the&mdash;er&mdash;dear departed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;And while we&rsquo;re about that, I&rsquo;m going
to wake up the lovers. You may not be
hungry, but I can eat a horse. If Deborah
is as good at cooking now that she has her
little Indian Chief, as she was before he came
to divert her mind from worthwhile things,
maybe we can get her to scare up a meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Charlie? We&rsquo;ve got to get
that kid away from the gang just as soon as
we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we must. But I can think
better when my stomach isn&rsquo;t so doggone
empty. Charlie is safe until the deadline
that Sanders gave me. Now for the Seminoles.
Lucky they&rsquo;re not on their natural
habitat&mdash;you and I would get a tomahawk
between the eyes&mdash;eh, Osceola?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="sc">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="small">BILL BLOWS UP</span></h2>
<p>Clocks in New Canaan were striking
seven next evening when Bill turned the
switch on the <i>Loening&rsquo;s</i> instrument board
which released the retractable landing gear
of the plane. Five or six seconds later he
spiralled down on the level field back of the
Bolton place, and taxied toward the hangar.</p>
<p>Wheelblocks in hand, he was climbing out
of the cockpit when a man ran up from the
direction of the Bolton garage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evening, Master Bill,&rdquo; he greeted.
&ldquo;Glad to see you back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Frank! I&rsquo;m glad to get home myself,
even though I won&rsquo;t be staying long.
Has my father returned home from Washington?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;No sir. That is, he ain&rsquo;t back in New
Canaan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I get something to eat, I&rsquo;m taking
the Buick down to Stamford. It may be
that I&rsquo;ll come back tonight, but if not, I&rsquo;ll
need the <i>Loening</i> tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir. I&rsquo;ll fill her and give her
a thorough looking over. Some doin&rsquo;s there
were here the night you left. By the time I
waked up and got the cops on the phone, them
guys had beat it. There was a wrecked car
what had run into a rope, stretched out
yonder, but they&rsquo;d took the license plates with
&rsquo;em. The cops think they can trace the car,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that won&rsquo;t get them anywhere. I&rsquo;ll
bet a hat the car was stolen. Anyway, I know
who the men were. I&rsquo;ve got a date with one
of them tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so, sir? Better let me go with you,
sir!&rdquo; Frank was all eagerness. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
them what says I ain&rsquo;t so worse in a scrap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Bill laughed and shook his head. &ldquo;Thanks
just the same, Frank. Some other time
maybe. There won&rsquo;t be any scrapping where
I&rsquo;m going this evening. This is just going
to be a quiet conference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank looked disappointed. &ldquo;Well, you
never can tell, sir. If it looks like somethin&rsquo;
interestin&rsquo;, I hope you&rsquo;ll give us a ring, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll be wid yer in three shakes of a lamb&rsquo;s
tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember, but don&rsquo;t be too hopeful.
So long now. I&rsquo;m off to get a bite at the house
before I start off again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long, Master Bill. I&rsquo;ll have the Buick
&rsquo;round front for you, soon as I wheel this crate
into the hangar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Bill again, and marched off
toward the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>In the kitchen he encountered the cook.
&ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t Master Bill home agin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
beamed that buxom female. &ldquo;Sure as I&rsquo;m a
sinner it&rsquo;s yer dinner ye&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;
divil a bit av it cooked yet. I give the help
theirn an hour ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Annie. But would it
be too much trouble to rustle me a couple of
sandwiches&mdash;or maybe three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie, hands on hips and arms akimbo,
looked indignant. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no sandwiches ye&rsquo;ll
be gettin&rsquo;, Master Bill. In half an hour I&rsquo;ll
have something hot and tasty dished up.
Can&rsquo;t ye be waitin&rsquo; that long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I sure can, Annie. But don&rsquo;t bother
too much. Anything will do. I&rsquo;m hungry
enough to eat shoe leather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you leave that to me,&rdquo; he heard her
say as he went toward the front of the house
and then up the stairs to his room.</p>
<p>He shut the door and picked up the French
phone from a night table by his bed. As soon
as central answered he called a Stamford
number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Evans there?&rdquo; he asked when a
man&rsquo;s voice answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Evans speaking. It sounds like Bill
Bolton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill Bolton is right, Mr. Evans. I&rsquo;m
home&mdash;in New Canaan&mdash;just got here by
plane. Deborah gave me your number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must be important. Spill the
story, boy. Tell me why you&rsquo;re not up in
Maine looking after my interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill told him, and it took him more than
ten minutes to do so. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he ended,
&ldquo;while Deborah was giving us a midnight
lunch on Pig Island, the five of us, Deborah,
old Jim, Osceola, Ezra and myself, went into
a session of the ways and means committee.
After some argument, it was decided that on
Charlie&rsquo;s account, I must come down here,
and at least pretend to follow Sanders&rsquo;
orders&mdash;to report to Johnson at Gring&rsquo;s
Hotel, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; concurred Mr. Evans, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
there&rsquo;s nothing else that you can do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that perhaps you might have
some men about, rush the joint and capture
this Johnson. Kind of tit for tat, you know.
We could swap him back to friend Sanders for
Charlie. That would even up things a bit.
Just now it seems to me that they have the
bulge on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it, Bill&mdash;they
have. Your plan&rsquo;s a good one, but it is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, although Slim Johnson
is a very young man, he is one of the cleverest
gangsters outside Sing Sing. Secondly, if
he didn&rsquo;t have an A No. 1 organization of
cutthroats and gunmen behind him, I&rsquo;d have
kidnapped that young gentleman long ago.
But tell me,&rdquo; he went on anxiously, &ldquo;what
are you fellows up there doing about my
boy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just this: after it was arranged that I
should come on here, Osceola elected himself
a committee of one to locate Sanders&rsquo; hide-out,
and to get his hands on Charlie. Parker
decided to stay on the island to guard Deborah,
for it seems that Jim is away most of
the time on special duty for you, which he
wouldn&rsquo;t divulge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And quite right, too,&rdquo; murmured Mr.
Evans. &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s work is a most important
factor&mdash;most important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all Greek to me. And although
you&rsquo;re running this show, sir, and with all due
apology, I must say it&rsquo;s my opinion that you
make a mistake in not putting more confidence
in the people who are helping you.
Look at me: Charlie blows in here and we
beat it up to Maine as fast as my plane and
good lead bullets will get us there. All kinds
of hush stuff when we arrive, then you beat
it off during the night, leaving us in a house
that&rsquo;s a warren of secret passages and what
not&mdash;and to make it worse, you leave us absolutely
no instructions. Consequently, one of
us gets kidnapped, and the other all but loses
his life, first by airgun bullets&mdash;and some airgun
it must be to shoot that distance&mdash;and
later, by drowning. Then I mistake the
people on Pig Island for your enemies, make
a fool of myself and darn near get kidnapped
into the bargain. As a direct result, instead
of being able to make myself useful in your
interests around Clayton, I have to chase off
down here to placate the chief of your
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot in what you say,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Evans. &ldquo;But you must understand that this is
an extremely serious affair&mdash;in which an
enormous sum of money is involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you make me tired,&rdquo; snapped Bill.
&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve had a sweet chance to sell you
out&mdash;lock, stock and barrel. Money, money,
money&mdash;that&rsquo;s all you so-called big business
men think of&mdash;and at that, you&rsquo;re the guys
we have to thank for the depression. Is any
amount of money worth Charlie&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t dare&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;They dared with poor little Charlie Lindbergh.
Are you any better than our national
hero?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like the way you&rsquo;re talking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t care a tinker&rsquo;s hoop what you
like. You&rsquo;re not paying me anything. Listen
to me&mdash;just as soon as we can find Charlie
for you, I&rsquo;m through! You want those who
are helping you to trust you and your judgment,
yet you won&rsquo;t trust them, and seem to
have as little respect for human life as did the
German High Command during the war!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; inquired an angry voice
at the other end of the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;there is. A slight error
on my part, or what might be construed as
an error. When I inferred that you willingly
risked human life in order to obtain
money, I naturally made an exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own valuable life, Mr. Evans!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>With this Parthian shot, Bill slapped on
the receiver and switched off the telephone
extension to his room. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;ll hold
him,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Gosh, I&rsquo;m glad I got
that off my chest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was under the shower in his bath when
there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted on the telephone, Master
William,&rdquo; called a maid&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
gentleman&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t give his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell the gentleman,&rdquo; called back Bill,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;m busy. If he is insistent, say that I
suggest he can go where snowballs melt the
fastest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dressed in a leisurely manner and went
down to the dining room, where he found a
hot meal awaiting him. He did full justice
to it, and about eight-thirty he went out the
front door, climbed in his car and drove off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>It was a twenty-minute drive down through
the ridge country to the city of Stamford,
where he parked his car in a garage off Atlantic
Street. From there he walked down
back streets and eventually came to Gring&rsquo;s
Hotel.</p>
<p>He had passed the place many times, and
knew that it held an unsavory reputation.
The building was a five-story frame structure,
and back in the early years of the century,
it had been a famous hostelry. The
neighborhood had gradually deteriorated,
until now the once-fashionable tavern reared
its ornamental fa&ccedil;ade amid slums of the worst
type. The police department had raided the
place so often that newspapers no longer regarded
that sort of thing as news. The hotel
still had a reputation for excellent food and
service, but it drew its patronage almost entirely
from the rough element, sometimes
criminal, sometimes merely tough, with
which every New England manufacturing
town is more or less cursed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Bill ran lightly up the steps to the long
veranda, a relic of better days. Paying no
attention to the stares of the loungers in the
lobby he crossed to the desk and caught the
clerk&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Phone up to Mr. Harold Johnson,&rdquo; directed
Bill. &ldquo;Say that Bill Bolton is down
here and would like to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, sir,&rdquo; returned the clerk and
spoke a few low words into the phone at the
rear of the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson will see you,&rdquo; he announced
a moment later. &ldquo;Take the elevator to the
fourth floor and turn left. The room number
is 49.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="sc">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="small">THE LAUNDRY HAMPER</span></h2>
<p>Bill stepped out of the elevator and
turned left as the clerk had directed. He
passed along the corridor until he came to a
door marked &ldquo;49.&rdquo; He stopped and knocked.
For a moment he waited, marshalling his
thoughts, then the door swung inwards and
he was confronted by a low-browed gorilla
of a man who held an automatic in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s room?&rdquo; Bill inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants to know?&rdquo; the man rasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name is Bolton,&rdquo; snapped Bill. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
flown down here from Clayton, Maine, especially
to see him if that means anything to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear your business if you&rsquo;ve got
any.&rdquo; The man continued to point the revolver
at Bill&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My business,&rdquo; he said evenly, &ldquo;is with
Mr. Johnson. If you work for the man who
sent me here I advise you to tell that to Mr.
Johnson&mdash;and tell it pronto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the spiel and let him in, Jake!&rdquo; called
a soft voice whose owner was hidden by the
half open door.</p>
<p>Jake muttered a surly curse, but he stepped
aside and Bill walked into the room. The
door slammed behind him and he heard the
key turn in the lock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>He was surprised to find himself in a large
and handsomely furnished sitting room.
Thick hangings of gold brocade were drawn
over the windows, shutting out the night and
with it the air. The room was close and filled
with tobacco smoke. Two massive couches
upholstered in brocade were set back to back
in the center of the room. One end of the
sitting room was filled by a huge mahogany
sideboard, loaded with bottles and glasses.
At the other end stood a round card table
covered with dark green felt. A number of
heavily upholstered arm chairs lined the
walls, and the polished floor was almost completely
covered with handsome Oriental rugs.
The walls were hung with a number of really
good hunting prints.</p>
<p>Bill glimpsed a door behind the card table,
but almost immediately his eyes focussed on
a young man who sat on the arm of one of
the couches. He was tall and very slender,
immaculately dressed in white flannels and a
light blue, double-breasted sports coat with
dull gold buttons. Bill was astonished to see
that the highly manicured nails of his white,
tapering fingers were tinted carmine. His
soft voice when he spoke lisped like a girl&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Slim Johnson,&rdquo; he said languidly.
&ldquo;What did you want to see me about, buddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill imitated Sanders&rsquo; quick, nervous nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zenas!&rdquo; he said, and waited....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; lisped young Johnson. &ldquo;Bill
Bolton, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;The guy that dished von
Hiemskirk&rsquo;s hash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Bill said shortly. &ldquo;I had orders
to be here at nine tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slim Johnson glanced at a diamond-studded
wristwatch. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re three minutes
late,&rdquo; he purred, &ldquo;but I guess that&rsquo;s near
enough. Take one of those chairs and make
yourself comfortable. I&rsquo;ll talk to you in
a few minutes.&rdquo; He turned to a man who
entered at that moment, a stockily built
bruiser, as rough in his appearance as Jake.</p>
<p>Bill sat down in a chair near the wall. Except
for the three men and himself, there was
no one else in the room, though it was apparently
furnished to accommodate a large
number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spill the beans, Hank,&rdquo; Johnson smiled
pleasantly on his henchman. &ldquo;Make it
snappy, though. I don&rsquo;t want to keep Mr.
Bolton waiting too long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Ye had me drug up here,&rdquo;
snarled Hank. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t done nuthin&rsquo;&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t help them guys highjackin&rsquo; the
truck. If I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; made a move they&rsquo;d have
put me on the spot right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Johnson smiled, &ldquo;come now&mdash;surely
that&rsquo;s a bit of an exaggeration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man glared belligerently about him.
&ldquo;If any guy says dat dem guys didn&rsquo;t have
the drop on me, he&rsquo;s a liar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy that is the unadulterated truth,
my boy, but the trouble is, you leave out a
few things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t left out nothin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you have!&rdquo; The purring voice
directed itself toward Bill. &ldquo;You see, Mr.
Bolton, the sad story runs this way. Last
night, Hank, who drives one of my trucks,
got highjacked with a full load by the Muller
gang up near Ridgefield. What he omits to
tell us is that Tubby Muller passed over half
a grand to him for his part of the job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Here, at a smothered exclamation from
Hank, his inquisitor put up a slim hand in
gentle protest. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t try to look like
the picture of injured innocence, Hank.
What Hank doesn&rsquo;t know, Mr. Bolton, is that
I have watched him for something like this
ever since he and Tubby got together up at
Glendale one night last week. And although
they were not advertising the fact, I heard of
it. Last night&mdash;and this will also be a surprise
to Hank&mdash;I was behind the stone wall
at the side of the road when he turned over
the truck, and <i>I saw Tubby hand him the
money</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slim Johnson&rsquo;s arm shot out like a serpent
uncoiling. There came a sharp click and
Hank rolled off the couch on to the floor.</p>
<p>Bill stared at the man&rsquo;s body in horrified
amazement. Then he heard the smooth voice
of Johnson speak again to him. &ldquo;Airguns,&rdquo;
he said pleasantly, &ldquo;certainly have their uses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Johnson slipped the revolver up his sleeve
again and crooked a finger at Jake. &ldquo;Take
that stiff out of here,&rdquo; he ordered in his lisping
tones, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s spoiling my rug and I paid
five grand for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Jake dragged the dead man through
the doorway beyond the card table, Slim
Johnson drew out a gold case, selected a cigarette
which he lighted, and filled his lungs
with smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you&rsquo;re shocked by the summary
justice you saw meted out,&rdquo; he remarked with
a return of his languid air. &ldquo;Treachery has
its own reward in this business. I&rsquo;m sorry if
it disturbed you, Mr. Bolton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill did not reply. He was thinking that
of all the cold-blooded murders he had ever
heard of, this was certainly the worst. He
saw now that the young man&rsquo;s languid effeminacy
was but a cloak to camouflage a nature
hard as nails and utterly ruthless. Nobody
had to tell him that he himself was in very
dangerous waters and that unless he could
handle this lady-like monster with kid gloves,
he, too, would be removed from the Oriental
rug as a piece of loathsome d&eacute;bris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Bill made an effort to be matter-of-fact.
&ldquo;Suppose we come to business,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I was about to propose, Mr.
Bolton, or shall I say &lsquo;Bill&rsquo;&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mind
if I call you Bill, do you? So much more
clubby, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; Bill felt that anything
would be preferable to this silly chatter. He,
therefore, took the plunge. &ldquo;You want to
know where Mr. Evans may be found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so. Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere in Stamford, I presume. Just
where, I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now. How about your phone
talk at seven-twenty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>Slim Johnson took a sheet of paper from
the inside pocket of his coat. &ldquo;Just about
everything, Bill, old thing,&rdquo; he smiled.
&ldquo;Everything except the number you called.
Here&rsquo;s a report of the conversation. Amusing
reading it makes, I must say. I might
mention that we have tapped your home line,
but the silly fool who listened in didn&rsquo;t wake
up until you&rsquo;d been put through to your friend
Evans. Come, let&rsquo;s have the number!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, Johnson,&rdquo; Bill said
steadily, although he fully expected to see
the gangster&rsquo;s arm shoot forward the next
instant, as it had done when Hank was killed.
&ldquo;You already know what I said to Evans.
Well, that goes with you too, so far as I&rsquo;m
concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slim Johnson gave him a quizzical glance.
Then he lit another cigarette, which he
smoked in a long gilded holder. For several
minutes he stared at a print above Bill&rsquo;s head
and sent smoke rings toward the ceiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;From what I know of your character,&rdquo;
he said at last, and his voice sounded to Bill
for all the world like the purr of a great cat
playing with its prey, &ldquo;you mean just what
you say&mdash;at present. By morning, you may
change your mind. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m afraid
we&rsquo;ll have to use other methods. Go in to the
bedroom now. I&rsquo;m sorry that you will have
to bear with all that&rsquo;s left of dear Hank for
a while; but we&rsquo;ll remove the body later.
Good night to you&mdash;and sweet dreams!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill saw that Jake stood by the door with
the automatic menacing him once more.
Without a word he got to his feet and walked
into the bedroom. Behind him the door
closed and he heard a bolt shot home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>In the soft glow from rose-shaded lamps,
Bill saw that this room was also of good size.
The place reminded him of those impossible
boudoir-bedrooms one sees portrayed on the
screen. The bed was a huge, canopied affair
of gilt and rose, and stood on a dais at one end
of the room. Twenty or thirty small pillows
covered with rose-colored silk were piled at
the head on a rose damask coverlet. The
walls and ceiling of the room were of white
painted wood with panels of rose silk framed
in gilt. On the hardwood floor, a rose rug,
silk-piled, was spread. A chaise lounge,
wicker arm chairs and mirrored tables laden
with jars and bottles all bore out the same
color scheme.</p>
<p>Bill thought that all that was needed to
complete the screen picture was a movie
actress lying back against the pillows, being
served with breakfast on a tray by a &ldquo;French&rdquo;
maid&mdash;&ldquo;Gosh! what a dump!&rdquo; He looked
about him, but saw no sign of Hank.</p>
<p>He investigated the two closed doors at one
end of the room, found that one led into the
wardrobe closet, where thirty or forty of
Slim&rsquo;s suits hung on padded hangers, together
with numberless other articles of wearing
apparel on the shelves. The other door
opened into a rose tiled bathroom. Onyx
shelves held piles of towels, sponges, soap,
bath salts in glass jars, and in one corner stood
a large wicker hamper, painted rose color.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Bill noticed that the single stained glass
window high in the bathroom wall was
barred. That gave him a new slant on the
plan. He went into the bedroom and pulled
the curtains back from the two windows there.
Both were crisscrossed with heavy bars of
steel.</p>
<p>Slim Johnson&rsquo;s bedroom was well protected
from all intruders, and he, Bill Bolton,
was as effectually a prisoner as though he had
been cast into an underground dungeon.</p>
<p>He stood near the door to the sitting room,
and through the panels he could hear the
mumble of voices. Instinctively he moved
nearer and placed his ear against the keyhole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Slim Johnson was speaking: &ldquo;Give him an
hour. He&rsquo;ll be in bed and asleep by that time.
Then go in there and remove the&mdash;er&mdash;laundry.
Better take Alec with you. It will
be heavy. Come along with me, now. I&rsquo;ve
got to see Dago Mike about that shipment he
landed tonight. It won&rsquo;t take long and then
we can come back to this job. If the big boss
makes us let that lad go after we torture him
in the morning&mdash;what he doesn&rsquo;t know about
the <i>laundry</i> won&rsquo;t hurt anybody, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill heard Johnson giggle, and then the
door slammed to the corridor. He straightened
himself thoughtfully, stared at the bed
and saw that a pair of silk pajamas, rose-hued,
had been laid out on the coverlet.
Slowly he walked into the bathroom again.</p>
<p>The next instant he had the lid of the
hamper open, and disclosed to view a bundle
of soiled shirts, crumpled pajamas, collars and
handkerchiefs. Bill scattered these articles
to right and left.</p>
<p>Then uncontrollably, he shrank back.
Huddled in the basket, doubled awry, was the
body of a man. Only the head and shoulders
were visible. But the head was the head of
Hank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="sc">Chapter XVI</span>
<br /><span class="small">THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Bill bent swiftly, caught up some of the
dirty linen and flung it into the hamper. He
had to pull himself together. <i>That</i>&mdash;that
was the explanation, of course, for Slim
Johnson&rsquo;s cryptic remarks about the laundry.
They were coming back in an hour. Would
they take the hamper and all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;It would mean just
that. Not even a gangster beer baron, or
whatever role Slim Johnson plays in the criminal
life of this state would permit him to
carry dead bodies through the public halls of
a hotel without causing comment! And
possibly another police raid.... No&mdash;Hank
was going out in the hamper. How many
more,&rdquo; he wondered, &ldquo;had traveled that route
before and would travel it again....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Like a flash the idea came to him. Of
course, it would be necessary to remove the
body&mdash;</p>
<p>He went back to the bedroom and threw
himself down on the chaise longue. He was
tired after his long hop, and felt nauseated
from his experience that evening. A glance
at his watch showed that it still lacked a few
minutes to ten o&rsquo;clock. He had been in
Gring&rsquo;s Hotel only an hour, and in that short
time, murder....</p>
<p>Resolutely he put the thought from him
and the thought of what he soon must do. His
eyes closed and gradually he dozed off into
light slumber.</p>
<p>It was a quarter to eleven when Bill awoke.
Chimes on a church clock somewhere in the
neighborhood were striking the quarter hour.
With a cry of annoyance, he sprang to the
locked door and listened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>No sound came from the sitting room.
Hastily extinguishing the bedroom lights, he
hurried into the bathroom and switched on a
single electric bulb.</p>
<p>He began to work with feverish haste, lifting
the limp body of Hank from the
hamper&mdash;<i>rigor mortis</i> had not yet set in. He
carried it to the bed, removed the coat and
waistcoat, slipped on the jacket of the
pajamas, turned down the rose-colored sheet
and covered the body&mdash;all but the head and
one arm, which appeared above the coverlet
in a natural position.</p>
<p>Bill was trembling like a leaf when that
was accomplished. But the worst was over.
He had now only to switch off the bathroom
light and take the place of Hank in the
clothes hamper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>He collected the linen he had scattered on
the floor, turned off the light and got into the
hamper with his armful of shirts and pajamas,
arranging himself as comfortably as he could
inside. The lid was hinged, and fell back
upon him when he had drawn a few pieces of
clothing over his head and assumed the position
formerly occupied by Hank.</p>
<p>He crouched, half-stifled, in the hamper,
listening for ages&mdash;it seemed. At last&mdash;the
bolt of the sitting room door clicked.</p>
<p>From within his hiding place Bill could
hear almost clearly what was happening in
the room. There came the faint creak of a
boot on the floor boards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep to the rug, you fool!&rdquo; hissed Johnson&rsquo;s
voice. &ldquo;Do you want to wake him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several minutes there was no other
sound. In his mind&rsquo;s eye he pictured the
young gangster tiptoeing to the bed and looking
down on the rose-colored pajamas&mdash;</p>
<p>Suddenly they were beside him. The
hamper was dragged away from the wall,
lifted and let down on the tiles again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy smoke! what a weight!&rdquo; a voice
whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up and come on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Again the hamper was lifted and carried
from the room. Outside in the corridor it
was set down for a moment while its bearers
locked the door. Then the angle at which
Bill was being carried shifted, the basket
rocked slowly up and down, as he descended
the stairs. There were a great many stairs&mdash;they
seemed endless. Twice he was set down
roughly, while the men paused for breath.</p>
<p>He had a desperate impulse to thrust open
the lid, tear away the suffocating clothes and
strike out for freedom. But the time was
not yet. He must be patient.</p>
<p>The air became cooler and he was able to
breathe more freely. He thought they must
be in the open now. The hamper was banged
down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slim,&rdquo; a voice spoke somewhere above
and he recognized it as Jake&rsquo;s, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t want
the bulls to get onto this. You remember
last time they dug up Otto and raised an
awful stink!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about this stiff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Hank&rsquo;s in luck. He gets a Christian
burial. There&rsquo;s one of them private family
cemeteries up Sulvermine way. Hank goes
in there. The tools are in the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just too bad Slim can&rsquo;t do his own
diggin&rsquo;,&rdquo; growled Number Two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not him&mdash;he&rsquo;s got a heavy date. There
he is now, watchin&rsquo; from the lobby. When
we&rsquo;re out of sight, he&rsquo;ll beat it. He ain&rsquo;t
even takin&rsquo; a bodyguard tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it&mdash;a skirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know? But if we don&rsquo;t
get goin&rsquo; he will start raisin&rsquo; the roof. Git
hold of this thing again&mdash;she&rsquo;ll go on the
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Bill was lifted. The basket swung
violently, then landed with a jar that shook
his bones. He sensed that rope was being
passed around the hamper to secure it to the
back of the car. There came the crisp slam
of a door, a continuous vibration, and a violent
jerk. They were off at last. The car was moving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Bill waited until he felt the automobile
swerve around the corner. Then he thrust upward
with all his might. The flimsy wicker
catch snapped, the lid flew back, and amid a
cascade of soiled laundry, he crawled out and
dropped to the roadway. An instant later, he
was strolling back toward the hotel. His late
conveyance had already disappeared around
the corner.</p>
<p>Swinging into the street upon which
Gring&rsquo;s Hotel fronted, halfway down the
block, he saw Slim Johnson run down the
steps and enter a taxicab. The car was headed
away from him and started off directly. Bill
at once sprinted after it, hoping that the Boston
Post Road traffic would hold it up at the
end of the block.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>His hope was fulfilled. The cab slowed
down, stopped and waited for the green light.
Bill had just time to grasp the spare tire on
the rear and take a precarious seat on the
inner rim when it started up again.</p>
<p>Across the Post Road and under the raised
tracks of the New York, New Haven and
Hartford it went, then into that network of
mean streets between the railroad and the
shore like a frightened cat up a back alley.</p>
<p>Near the harbor the car slowed down and
drew up before an open lot. Bill dropped
off and hid behind a pile of rubbish. Slim
Johnson got out, paid off the driver and
started away at a smart pace toward the
docks. With his weather eye open, Bill followed
him, running swiftly across the patches
of light from the street lamps and seeking the
shadow.</p>
<p>The gangster followed the harbor toward
the sea front, wending his way among the
wharves. At length, by the side of a pier, he
stopped, and gave a shrill whistle. Bill
stepped behind a small wooden hut and took
a survey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Lying out among other vessels was the
white prow of a large yacht. He could just
discern its lines in the dim moonlight. There
was a lantern at the bows, and a glimmer at
one or two of the portholes.</p>
<p>Soon he heard the creak and dip of oars,
and could see the silver sparkle of flashing
water. A small boat drew into the pier. Slim
made his way carefully down the steps, disappearing
from Bill&rsquo;s view. There was the
rasp of an oar on stonework as the boat was
pushed off. Bill could distinguish the man&rsquo;s
lisping tones as he talked. Then the boat
melted into the darkness, in the general direction
of the yacht.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>For a few minutes Bill gazed across the
water at its outlines. Suddenly there was a
bright flood of light upon the deck. A door
flung open, a tall figure blocked it, and the
light narrowed to a slit and winked out as
the door closed again. While Bill stood
watching from the pier, he would have given
anything to know who the others were on
board that vessel. Still hot with anger and
horror at being forced to witness the dastardly
crime, and sickened with the part he had had
to play later, Bill was not in the mood to
forego an opportunity of evening things up.</p>
<p>It came to his mind that even to approach
the yacht in a small boat, keeping his eyes and
ears open, might be of some help in learning
who was aboard her, or perhaps yield him a
clue to the truth about Slim Johnson&rsquo;s business.
But a small boat was not easy to procure
at that time of night, and in any case he
did not want any inquisitive soul to know
what he was doing. As he walked slowly
along the wharf his foot struck a rope, and
looking down, he saw it held a small dinghy
that lay in the water at the edge of the dock.
It probably belonged to a yachtsman who had
come ashore. A find, if ever he needed one.
No time now to have any compunctions about
its owner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Bill looked across at the yacht, with its
portholes showing dim glints of light, and
in a trice he was on his knees. He slipped
the knot of the rope and hurried down the
wet steps.</p>
<p>The white yacht was farther out than he
had thought, and when he reached it, he was
astonished at its size and magnificence. A
shaft of light burst from the door where he
had seen the gangster enter. Johnson appeared
on deck, and Bill was actually so near
that he could see the pleased expression on his
smiling face. The dinghy drifted under the
yacht&rsquo;s bows, and he was shut out from view,
but he could hear Slim&rsquo;s feet passing along
the deck and clattering down the companionway.
Then there was the sharp slam of a
door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Softly Bill sculled along at the side of the
yacht. Over the portholes curtains were
drawn, so he could see nothing of what was
going on inside. The moon was hidden behind
clouds, and it was now so dark that he
nearly ran into a tiny wooden landing stage.
As he paused with the dinghy close under
the narrow steps, he could hear the clink of
dishes, as if a late meal was being prepared;
and a skylight nearby threw the sound of
excited conversation out on to the deck.</p>
<p>Each moment Bill kept reminding himself
that he ought to be getting back. What if
the owner of the dinghy were to appear and
send angry halloos across the water? Still,
having got so far, to retire without finding
out what Johnson was up to seemed stupid.
He made up his mind he would take a quick
survey of the deck before moving off. He
slung the rope around the bottom rung of the
ladder, and cautiously felt his way upward.</p>
<p>The deck was empty so far as he could make
out. If a hand was supposed to be on watch,
Bill could not hear or see any signs of him.
The large skylight came into view on deck,
and the shimmer of its thick glass indicated
that the saloon below was lighted up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>Bill crouched at the rail, listening. The
snatches of animated talk he had heard from
the water must have come from this saloon,
for he could see that one of the skylight
windows was raised a couple of inches. Now
he could distinguish through the opening the
clear tones of two voices in particular.</p>
<p>With the utmost caution, Bill crawled a
couple of yards forward and looked down
into the saloon. There was a white damask-covered
table, with shaded lights, at which
sat two men, busy with supper and conversation.
He recognized the men at once.</p>
<p>Slim Johnson&rsquo;s languid gestures emphasized
his words, as he directed them, between
sips of coffee, to no less a person than Zenas
Sanders himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>With a gasp, Bill realized that Sanders had
come by plane, and that this yacht must be
the leader&rsquo;s present headquarters. To go
back now was out of the question. He might
be on the brink of a vital discovery. He
glanced up and down the deck. Still it was
deserted. Pulling himself close to the skylight,
he lay listening, with every muscle taut.</p>
<p>Slim Johnson was speaking, and at first
Bill could not pick up the trend of his remarks.
But when Sanders replied, he realized their
talk had been bearing on himself and the
interview at Gring&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Slim,&rdquo; said Sanders.
&ldquo;Young Bolton has practically broken with
Evans. All he cares about now is getting the
kid back. He said so over the phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that darned Indian is sure to find
your hideaway, Sanders. He&rsquo;s got plenty of
guts and so has that Parker fellow by all reports.
Between them, they&rsquo;ll get the boy
before this yacht has a chance to reach Twin
Heads Harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Sanders laughed and shook his head in a
nervous negative. &ldquo;Oh, no, they won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he
chuckled. &ldquo;The boy isn&rsquo;t up there. I
brought him with me. At present he&rsquo;s sound
asleep in a cabin not twenty feet from where
we&rsquo;re sitting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a good one!&rdquo; Slim laughed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the orders now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sail in two hours. I want you to
come along. Go back to the hotel now and
use your gentle persuasion on Bill Bolton to
find out where Evans is. We&rsquo;ll hold them on
board until the divers have brought the stuff
up from the bottom of the harbor up there.
Then we can either make all three of them
pay heavy ransoms, or if they&rsquo;re obdurate, tie
them up and drop them overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But supposing torture won&rsquo;t make Bolton
tell?&rdquo; argued Slim. &ldquo;What shall I do with
him then? You aren&rsquo;t giving me much time
to persuade him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, use your air gun if you like. It&rsquo;s all
the same to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let Old Evans go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He&rsquo;s tired of trying to
watch us up there. And that old diver of
his&mdash;Jim something-or-other, hasn&rsquo;t located
the stuff yet. Evans thinks that he has a
better bet in watching you. So mind your
step when you come back tonight. The
longer Mr. Evans stops in Stamford the better
pleased I&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. It&rsquo;s a swell break, and the luckiest
thing about it is that he can&rsquo;t bring in the
bulls. He and his bank would pay a pretty
fine if the government found out that he was
taking that gold to Europe in his yacht when
von Hiemskirk captured it. Nice of the noble
baron to sink it in Twin Heads Harbor, and
then go to Atlanta for thirty or forty years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be able to blackmail Evans later,
after he&rsquo;s paid his ransom, and we&rsquo;ve got away
with the gold.&mdash;Listen!&rdquo; Sanders dropped
his voice and began to whisper across the
table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Bill pressed closer to the skylight, and at
the same time a door clicked somewhere along
the deck. In a second he was crouching on
hands and knees, peering into the darkness.
The figure of a man swung up the companionway
and paused to light a cigarette. Bill
could see his thin, swarthy face, lined and
scarred, as the tiny flame leaped within his
cupped palms. The match spun overboard in
a luminous curve, and hissed into the water.
Then the man began to walk slowly along the
deck toward Bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="sc">Chapter XVII</span>
<br /><span class="small">BILL&rsquo;S WAY</span></h2>
<p>The moment that the match struck the
water found Bill wriggling across the deck
like a sand-eel. The red tip of the cigarette
in the man&rsquo;s mouth glowed and waned as he
drew in the smoke. A bright point in the
darkness, it moved forward, and in its soft
luster Bill could distinguish the shiny peak
and white linen top of the man&rsquo;s yachting
cap, beneath which his face was a dim brown
blur. Everything else was in black obscurity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>As quickly as a cat, Bill slipped down the
ladder and, pressing his body against the side
of the yacht, lay motionless. It was unlikely
that the man would descend, for Bill had seen
no boat tethered at the tiny square stage below.
And now he prayed that this yacht&rsquo;s
officer would not select the spot directly
above him to pause for contemplation of the
night sky.</p>
<p>The man drew nearer, hesitated, as if
halted by the sound of talk in the saloon below,
then passed on. The slow tread of his
rubber soles grew fainter, and Bill knew that
he had strolled to the other side of the deck.
Now was his chance. For an instant he
glanced down at the dinghy. That would be
the easier way, but&mdash;well, there was no telling
what might happen if he went ashore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>He hastily unlaced his shoes, stuffed them
in his coat pocket, and bending low, ran
lightly along the deck toward the door
whence the officer had emerged. Down the
companionway he darted and at the bottom
found himself in a narrow passage which
bisected this part of the yacht fore and aft.
Being familiar with this type of craft, he
guessed that the passage ran forward from
the saloon where Slim and Sanders were still
conferring, to the galley and the crew&rsquo;s
quarters. On either side were the closed
doors of the cabins. He listened for a second
at the door nearest the stairs, turned the knob
and pushed it open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Petersen?&rdquo; inquired a sleepy
voice from within the dark cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner wants young Evans in the
saloon,&rdquo; growled Bill, trusting that his voice
sounded not too unlike Petersen&rsquo;s, who he
guessed was finishing his smoke on deck. He
was without weapon of any kind. If the man
in the cabin became suspicious, he must run
for it.</p>
<p>He heard a prodigious yawn. &ldquo;Well, I
ain&rsquo;t that kid&rsquo;s nurse,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;You
ought to know, he&rsquo;s in Number 3. The key&rsquo;s
in the door. Fetch him yourself. High
tide&rsquo;s at two bells and we shove off then. For
the love of Mike, get out of here and let me
catch forty winks!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Bill hurriedly closed the door and looked
around for Number 3. There was a night
light burning in the passage and by its dim
rays he soon found the cabin, just forward
of the companionway. He unlocked it,
slipped inside and shut the door after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; piped a shrill voice, and one that
he recognized this time. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big
idea? For the twenty-seventh time I&rsquo;ll tell
you I don&rsquo;t know where my father is&mdash;and I
care less. Beat it, and let a feller sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down, Charlie, it&rsquo;s Bill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bill!</i>&rdquo; almost shrieked the boy. &ldquo;Gee
whizz, but I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come. It&rsquo;s so dark
in here&mdash;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what you thought. Hustle
it up, kid&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to get out of here in a
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I get my clothes on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill felt rather than saw the small figure
beside him and caught Charlie&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;No
time for clothes. You&rsquo;re wearing something&mdash;what
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;One of old Sanders&rsquo; nightshirts,&rdquo; Charlie
ruefully returned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a million sizes too
big&mdash;as usual, they chuck anything at a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think you are&mdash;&rdquo; whispered
Bill, &ldquo;the Prince of Wales?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled Charlie toward the door, opened
it and looked out. Someone was coming down
the companionway, whistling Yankee Doodle
and flatting horribly. Bill jerked back, kept
the cabin door on a crack and waited.
Presently a door further down the passage
slammed and Yankee Doodle was suddenly
and mercifully cut short.</p>
<p>Bill wasted no time. Into the corridor,
followed by Charlie, he sprang. Number 3
was hurriedly locked and the two ran up the
companionway, their bare feet making no
noise on the brass-bound rubber treads.
Both lads leapt across the deck, slithered into
the dinghy and pushed off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>The tide was on the flood and made a
splashing noise against the hull sufficient to
muffle the click of the oars as Bill dropped
them into the row-locks. Gritting his teeth,
he took three or four long strokes and then
sat still. In the swing of the tide the dinghy
drifted silently away from the vessel, and was
lost among other crafts at anchor nearby.</p>
<p>They gave the yacht a wide berth, one lad
at the oars, the other crouched in the stern of
the rowboat. Bill used its lights, however,
to get his bearings on the pier steps. He half
expected some angry yachtsman to be waiting
with threats to wring his neck for such bare-faced
robbery. They were still a couple of
hundred yards off the wharf when a sea-going
tug swung round the riding lights of an
anchored sloop. Bill heard the clang of the
engine room bell, and almost directly the
powerful craft slowed down, her propeller
blades churning the water to foam. A voice
hailed them from the deck forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinghy ahoy! Scull over here and let&rsquo;s
see who ye are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants to know?&rdquo; piped up Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Stamford Harbor Police Patrol
wants ter know, sonny&mdash;that&rsquo;s who. Give us
no more of your lip. Come aboard and let&rsquo;s
see what ye got in that there rowboat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; said Bill, and pulled toward
the tug which was drifting slowly with the
tide.</p>
<p>They were but a few yards off her side when
a blinding light struck the dinghy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t ye get that dum thing workin&rsquo;
before, Pat?&rdquo; growled another voice above
their heads. &ldquo;Them ain&rsquo;t the guys we&rsquo;re
lookin&rsquo; for. There ain&rsquo;t no booze aboard
that dinghy&mdash;nothin&rsquo; but a couple o&rsquo; lads.
An&rsquo; one of em&rsquo;s stole his grandmother&rsquo;s night
shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, your eye!&rdquo; sang out
Charlie, who knew he looked ridiculous, and
was in no mood to appreciate the tug crew&rsquo;s
laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, kid,&rdquo; ordered Bill, and then in
a louder voice: &ldquo;We are looking for the police.
There&rsquo;s worse than booze-running going on
out here tonight. Any objection to our
coming aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come aboard, bub&mdash;tell us yer troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were helped overside by a man in
trousers and a cotton undershirt. Upon closer
inspection he proved to be a short and stubby
individual with very black eyes and hair and
a round face badly in need of a shave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; now what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in command of this craft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, young man. Sergeant Duffy&rsquo;s the
name. Now let&rsquo;s have yer monikers&mdash;an&rsquo; all
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Bolton, I live in New
Canaan,&rdquo; began Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Not the midshipman whose name
was in all the papers fer capturin&rsquo; that pirate
liner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;I have to plead guilty
to the charge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>Sergeant Duffy shook him warmly by the
hand. &ldquo;I recognize ye now from the pictures,&rdquo;
he beamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to meet ye,
sor. It&rsquo;s an honor, it is.... An&rsquo; the young
man wid ye&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be Charlie Evans, if I&rsquo;m
not mistaken? Where in the seven seas did
ye locate the lad? His father had his kidnappin&rsquo;
broadcasted t&rsquo;night, but it said them
fellies had got him away down east&mdash;Clayton,
Maine, was the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I found him locked up aboard that
yacht, the one that&rsquo;s showing lights over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Katrina</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know her name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Katrina&rsquo;s</i> right,&rdquo; cut in Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feller by the name of Sanders is owner,&rdquo;
offered the Sergeant. &ldquo;He lives on Shippan
Point.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;is the guy. Anyway,
he&rsquo;s in cahoots with Slim Johnson, the gangster
whom I saw murder a man called Hank
tonight. They&rsquo;re both on board the <i>Katrina</i>
now, and I have every reason to believe that
Sanders was the brains of von Hiemskirk&rsquo;s
pirate gang. That yacht, by the way, is
shoving off for Maine at the turn of the tide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, she ain&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; declared the policeman.
&ldquo;By gorry, we&rsquo;ll attend to the <i>Katrina</i>
in a jiffy. I&rsquo;m sendin&rsquo; ye ashore wid Kelly.
He&rsquo;s got to call up headquarters, and you can
&rsquo;phone Mr. Evans at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go with you and see the fun?&rdquo;
begged Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ye can&rsquo;t, young man. Ye&rsquo;re my responsibility
now, and the two of ye have had
enough excitement fer tonight, I&rsquo;ll be thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very much obliged to you, Sergeant,&rdquo;
said Bill, shaking hands again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>Sergeant Duffy shook his bullet head.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me who&rsquo;s thankin&rsquo; you, sor. This is
big business in our line. It&rsquo;s the chanct I&rsquo;ve
been waitin&rsquo; more than five years for. It
will mean my lieutenancy, Mister Bolton.
And just remember, sor, if any o&rsquo; thim dumb
motorcycle cops hold ye up fer speedin&rsquo; any
time, tell &rsquo;em you&rsquo;re a friend o&rsquo; Duffy&rsquo;s! If
they don&rsquo;t let ye go, I&rsquo;ll break &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill grinned and nodded and they hurried
overside into the dinghy where a husky
policeman was already at the oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat it, Kelly,&rdquo; Duffy flung after them,
&ldquo;and &rsquo;phone the chief to break out a bunch of
his flat-feet and get &rsquo;em down to the wharf on
the run. Now you men,&rdquo; they heard him
say as they drew away from the patrol boat,
&ldquo;rip them covers off the guns and git under
way. The <i>Katrina</i> over yonder&rsquo;s got a bunch
o&rsquo; murderin&rsquo; kidnappers on her, and we&rsquo;re the
lads what will run &rsquo;em in the cells, sure as
Saint Patrick run the snakes out o&rsquo; the old
country!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>The wharf was deserted. After knotting
the dinghy&rsquo;s painter to an iron ringbolt, the
lads followed Kelly across the rough planking
to the small shack Bill had hidden behind
while watching Slim Johnson.</p>
<p>Kelly produced a key and went inside.
From the doorway they heard him call Police
Headquarters and pour forth the sergeant&rsquo;s
message into the &rsquo;phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bill,&rdquo; said Charlie, &ldquo;you certainly
handed Sanders and his bunch a red hot
wallop. What will they do to them, do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder is a hanging matter in this state,
Charlie, and kidnapping means a long term in
state&rsquo;s prison. When Sanders and Company
get through with that, there will still be a
federal charge of piracy against them on the
Flying Fish job that we cleaned up a few
weeks ago.&rdquo; He broke off as Kelly came out
and told him he could use the &rsquo;phone. Two
minutes later, he had Mr. Evans on the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill Bolton speaking, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
found Charlie. He&rsquo;s safe and sound and
with me now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Bill heard him exclaim,
and went on talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was so rude earlier this evening,&rdquo;
he apologized. &ldquo;I misjudged you,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand how you felt, Bill. But I&rsquo;d
already broadcasted the boy&rsquo;s abduction when
you called, and&mdash;but never mind about that
now. Where are you, and what&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill gave him a hurried resume of the evening&rsquo;s
adventures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sanders,&rdquo; said Charlie&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;got one
thing wrong. I wasn&rsquo;t transporting that gold
to Europe in the <i>Merrymaid</i>. It was bound
for two banks in New Orleans&mdash;ten million
dollars of it. The reason I didn&rsquo;t call in the
police was not because I feared Federal censure,
but because I was afraid if Sanders was
frightened, he would drop depth bombs on
the place and scatter the gold so that no one
could find it. I knew it had been sunk by
von Hiemskirk and his pirates somewhere off
Twin Heads, but had no idea it was in the
harbor. Now we&rsquo;ll get it easily enough. And
that reminds me, Deborah telephoned half
an hour ago. Osceola found Sanders&rsquo; headquarters
this afternoon. He had an armed
camp in the woods across the harbor from
Turner&rsquo;s. The chief got the State&rsquo;s police on
the job and tonight they captured the place
and every man-jack of them except Sanders,
who you say is aboard his yacht down here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; interrupted Bill. He
listened while Kelly called to him from the
open doorway. &ldquo;The policeman with us,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;says the <i>Katrina</i> has been
taken. He can see the prisoners being moved
aboard the patrol boat. He also tells me he
will run us up town in his flivver. Goodbye
for the present. I&rsquo;ll have Charlie with you
just as soon as we can get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later, while they were being
driven toward the heart of Stamford in the
police car, Charlie turned to his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee whizz, Bill, I clean forgot to thank
you for getting me away from that gang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, kid.
You&rsquo;d do the same for me any day, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie smiled complacently. &ldquo;I sure
would, Bill,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but take it from
me, if you&rsquo;re going to get kidnapped, bring a
pair of pajamas along&mdash;these nightshirts
make a monkey out of a man!&rdquo;</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p class="pg">1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p class="pg">1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p class="pg">1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p class="pg">1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p class="pg">1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p class="pg">This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pg">1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p class="pg">1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p class="pg">1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p class="pg">1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p class="pg">1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pg">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p class="pg">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pg">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pg">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p class="pg">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p class="pg">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p class="pg">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
